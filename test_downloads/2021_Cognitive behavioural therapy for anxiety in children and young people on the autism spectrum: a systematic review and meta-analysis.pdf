        <title>Cognitive behavioural therapy for anxiety in children and young people on the autism spectrum: a systematic review and meta-analysis | BMC Psychology | Full Text</title>

        
    
    <meta name="citation_abstract" content="Anxiety is common in youth on the autism spectrum and cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) has been adapted to address associated symptoms. The aim of the current systematic review and meta-analysis was to examine the efficacy of CBT for reducing anxiety in autistic youth. Searches of PubMed and Scopus databases were undertaken from January 1990 until December 2020. Studies were included if they consisted of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) using CBT to reduce anxiety in autistic youth. Separate random effects meta-analyses assessed anxiety ratings according to informant (clinician; parent; child), both at end-of-trial and at follow-up. A total of 19 RCTs met our inclusion criteria (833 participants: CBT N&#8201;=&#8201;487; controls N&#8201;=&#8201;346). Random effects meta-analyses revealed a large effect size for clinician rated symptoms (g&#8201;=&#8201;0.88, 95% CI 0.55, 1.12, k&#8201;=&#8201;11), while those for both parent (g&#8201;=&#8201;0.40, 95% CI 0.24, 0.56; k&#8201;=&#8201;18) and child-reported anxiety (g&#8201;=&#8201;0.25, 95% CI 0.06, 0.43; k&#8201;=&#8201;13) were smaller, but significant. These benefits were not however maintained at follow-up. Moderator analyses showed that CBT was more efficacious for younger children (for clinician and parent ratings) and when delivered as individual therapy (for clinician ratings). Using the Cochrane Risk of Bias 2 tool, we found concerns about reporting bias across most trials. The efficacy of CBT for anxiety in autistic youth was supported in the immediate intervention period. However, substantial inconsistency emerged in the magnitude of benefit depending upon who was rating symptoms (clinician, parent or child). Follow-up analyses failed to reveal sustained benefits, though few studies have included this data. It will be important for future trials to address robustness of treatment gains overtime and to further explore inconsistency in efficacy by informant. We also recommend pre-registration of methods by trialists to address concerns with reporting bias."/>

    <meta property="og:description" content="Background Anxiety is common in youth on the autism spectrum and cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) has been adapted to address associated symptoms. The aim of the current systematic review and meta-analysis was to examine the efficacy of CBT for reducing anxiety in autistic youth. Method Searches of PubMed and Scopus databases were undertaken from January 1990 until December 2020. Studies were included if they consisted of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) using CBT to reduce anxiety in autistic youth. Separate random effects meta-analyses assessed anxiety ratings according to informant (clinician; parent; child), both at end-of-trial and at follow-up. Results A total of 19 RCTs met our inclusion criteria (833 participants: CBT N&#8201;=&#8201;487; controls N&#8201;=&#8201;346). Random effects meta-analyses revealed a large effect size for clinician rated symptoms (g&#8201;=&#8201;0.88, 95% CI 0.55, 1.12, k&#8201;=&#8201;11), while those for both parent (g&#8201;=&#8201;0.40, 95% CI 0.24, 0.56; k&#8201;=&#8201;18) and child-reported anxiety (g&#8201;=&#8201;0.25, 95% CI 0.06, 0.43; k&#8201;=&#8201;13) were smaller, but significant. These benefits were not however maintained at follow-up. Moderator analyses showed that CBT was more efficacious for younger children (for clinician and parent ratings) and when delivered as individual therapy (for clinician ratings). Using the Cochrane Risk of Bias 2 tool, we found concerns about reporting bias across most trials. Conclusions The efficacy of CBT for anxiety in autistic youth was supported in the immediate intervention period. However, substantial inconsistency emerged in the magnitude of benefit depending upon who was rating symptoms (clinician, parent or child). Follow-up analyses failed to reveal sustained benefits, though few studies have included this data. It will be important for future trials to address robustness of treatment gains overtime and to further explore inconsistency in efficacy by informant. We also recommend pre-registration of methods by trialists to address concerns with reporting bias."/>

The aim of the current systematic review and meta-analysis was to examine the efficacy of CBT for reducing anxiety in autistic youth.</p><h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" data-test="abstract-sub-heading">Method</h3><p>Searches of PubMed and Scopus databases were undertaken from January 1990 until December 2020. Studies were included if they consisted of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) using CBT to reduce anxiety in autistic youth. Separate random effects meta-analyses assessed anxiety ratings according to informant (clinician; parent; child), both at end-of-trial and at follow-up.</p><h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" data-test="abstract-sub-heading">Results</h3><p>A total of 19 RCTs met our inclusion criteria (833 participants: CBT N = 487; controls N = 346). Random effects meta-analyses revealed a large effect size for clinician rated symptoms (<i>g</i> = 0.88, 95% CI 0.55, 1.12, k = 11), while those for both parent (<i>g</i> = 0.40, 95% CI 0.24, 0.56; k = 18) and child-reported anxiety (<i>g</i> = 0.25, 95% CI 0.06, 0.43; k = 13) were smaller, but significant. These benefits were not however maintained at follow-up. Moderator analyses showed that CBT was more efficacious for younger children (for clinician and parent ratings) and when delivered as individual therapy (for clinician ratings). Using the Cochrane Risk of Bias 2 tool, we found concerns about reporting bias across most trials.</p><h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" data-test="abstract-sub-heading">Conclusions</h3><p>The efficacy of CBT for anxiety in autistic youth was supported in the immediate intervention period. However, substantial inconsistency emerged in the magnitude of benefit depending upon who was rating symptoms (clinician, parent or child). Follow-up analyses failed to reveal sustained benefits, though few studies have included this data. It will be important for future trials to address robustness of treatment gains overtime and to further explore inconsistency in efficacy by informant. We also recommend pre-registration of methods by trialists to address concerns with reporting bias.</p></div></div></section>

They state that adaptation is less contingent on abilities such as introspection and emphasise the need for a more practical focus that prioritises behavioural over cognitive mechanisms for change. More recently, drawing on the views of practitioners and trialists, modifications were categorised under three areas: additions to treatment protocols to better accommodate the needs of autistic people (e.g. allowing clients not to make eye contact), leaving things out, (e.g. focus on core beliefs) and modifying conventional practice (e.g. diversifying communication techniques) [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 25" title="Spain D, Happé F.

The researchers also highlighted important moderators of treatment gains. Specifically, parent involvement and longer treatment protocols were found to advance more benefit. Although Perihan et al. is the most current evidence synthesis, its conclusions are limited by the inclusion of 7 out of 24 samples (30%) being from non-randomised studies. Whilst it is useful to summarise all available evidence, in meta-analysis, this requires consideration of study design features and adjustment of estimates of effect sizes [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 35" title="Faber T, Ravaud P, Riveros C, Perrodeau E, Dechartres A.

Further, the pooling of both between-group comparisons of CBT versus controls with pre-post effect sizes within CBT groups and the pooling of anxiety measures within trials (i.e. where multiple informant measures were taken) is also problematic.

More crucially, like Perihan et al., Ung et al. also included non-randomised samples (2/14 studies) and pooled data across informants (self, parent and clinician). This could mask important discrepancies that impact the overall judgement of clinical efficacy. It is recognised that children and young people frequently differ in reporting symptom experience as compared to parents and clinicians [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 37" title="Smith SR.

They analysed raters separately, with effect sizes of 1.21, 1.19 and 0.68 for clinicians (k = 5), parents (k = 6) and child (k = 5) respectively. These effect sizes were reduced with the removal of one extreme outlier in each analysis to 0.89, 0.57 and 0.17 respectively. While the data from Sukhodolsky and colleagues points to some large discrepancies, the number of trials included was small.

For clinician ratings, which were blind, we found a large effect (<i>g</i> = 0.88) versus a moderate effect for parent rated symptoms (<i>g</i> = 0.58), although the latter reduced following the removal of one extreme outlier (<i>g</i> = 0.42). For child/self-rated symptoms, we found a small to moderate effect (<i>g</i> = 0.47), which again reduced after removal of one extreme outlier (<i>g</i> = 0.25). A direct analysis in 6 trials using all three informant ratings confirmed a larger effect size for clinicians (<i>g =</i>1.71 [0.66–1.69]) than for both parents (<i>g </i>= 0.58 [0.24–0.91]) and the self-ratings of children, with the latter being non-significant (<i>g </i>= 0.26 [− 0.01 to 0.53]) in this sub-analysis.</p><p>Turning to factors that might moderate the efficacy of CBT, we could divide them broadly into those relating to the participants, and those relating to the therapy itself. Turning to participant variables, meta-regression suggested that the benefits of CBT may be more pronounced in younger children. This may suggest better developmental tailoring of intervention protocols, with room to enhance therapeutic techniques for older children. Gender was not a significant moderator, although females are generally under-represented in autism research, impacting the power of an analysis to detect a true effect. We also found no effect for the proportion of those identified as having Asperger syndrome or PDD-NOS. Turning to effects related to the therapy itself, the duration of CBT was not found to be a contributing factor, but this likely reflects most trials including a similar number of sessions (i.e. 16). Our subgroup comparison of group versus individual CBT revealed only one significant advantage for individual therapy for clinician ratings; all other informant rating revealed no differences. The advantage for individual therapy for clinician ratings however needs to be interpreted cautiously as it involved just 2 group versus 7 individual trials.</p><p>An important difference between the current meta-analysis and those of both Ung et al.

In the current larger sample of RCTs (more than twice as many), we similarly found large variability across informant ratings—with clinicians producing a large effect, a moderate effect for parents and a small effect for the children/ young people themselves. Furthermore, this informant discrepancy pattern emerged in studies using all three informant measures, and so, does not reflect inter-trial variability. Informant discrepancies have been acknowledged as ubiquitous in research on the assessment, development, and treatment of childhood problems [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 64" title="De Los RA, Augenstein TM, Wang M, Thomas SA, Drabick DA, Burgers DE, Rabinowitz J.

Rather than being averaged away, informant inconsistency requires careful investigation.</p><p>The most notable feature of course is the large effect size reported for clinicians and the fact that the children/young people themselves report little or no reduction of anxiety following CBT. The clinician and self-ratings reported here also differ in one other critical manner and that is that all clinician ratings were made blind. Arguably, blinded clinician ratings reporting greater symptom improvement might reflect the ability of skilled professionals to unpick the overlap of anxiety symptoms from features of autism per se, though this distinction is a source of debate [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 66" title="Kerns CM, Kendall PC.

Given that the children/young people themselves are reporting little change in their anxiety, it might be tempting to think that either they are reluctant or somehow unable to identify their anxiety and that the adult ratings are more accurate. Informant discrepancies are likely to be greater for internalising (such as anxiety and mood) over externalising mental health concerns (such as aggression and hyperactivity) [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 68" title="Achenbach TM.

However, the difference between the two sets of adult raters (clinicians and parents) was just as large; and it does seem as though clinicians are producing much greater effect sizes than either parents or children.</p><p>The lack of consensus on the ‘gold standard’ measure of anxiety for autistic youth [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 61" title="Lecavalier L, Wood JJ, Halladay AK, Jones NE, Aman MG, Cook EH, Handen BL, King BH, Pearson DA, Hallett V, Sullivan KA.

There are two ways to explore these assertions further. The first is for future trials to utilise measures of parent and self-report anxiety that are developed specifically for autistic youth. Such measures should offer a more relevant and reliable profile of symptoms by informants. For example, the 25-item Parent Reported Anxiety Scale (PRAS-ASD) [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 72" title="Scahill L, Lecavalier L, Schultz RT, Evans AN, Maddox B, Pritchett J, Herrington J, Gillespie S, Miller J, Amoss RT, Aman MG.

We also advocate qualitative follow-up in trials to uncover how youth and parents describe intervention benefits. This would further insights into mechanistic elements, and crucially, offer explanations as to why differences exist between the informants of anxious symptoms.</p><p>Where outcome reporting beyond post-treatment effects was included in trials, we restricted our analyses to studies that did this consistently (i.e. control participants included). Although we identified 23 sets of follow-up data from various informant groups, only 8 followed-up the control group and these all came from 5 trials. This resulted in synthesis of parent and child rated anxiety only and yielded no support for sustained treatment effects at follow-up (range 1–9 months). Whilst data from studies in the general population have supported the long-term effectiveness of CBT for anxiety in youth [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 74" title="Kodal A, Fjermestad K, Bjelland I, Gjestad R, Öst LG, Bjaastad JF, Haugland BS, Havik OE, Heiervang E, Wergeland GJ.

Given the small numbers of trials with follow-up data, we would apply some caution in interpreting. Nonetheless, parents, providers and service commissioners in particular will benefit from knowing the extent to which CBT facilitates lasting improvement in functioning; and such information will help set expectations for families. By identifying predictors of sustained gain versus relapse, clinicians might also be able to better optimise treatment protocols and so future trials need to attend to this.</p><p>Some caveats need to be acknowledged when interpreting the current findings. The first relates to the assessment of risk of bias, which had not been examined in the three previous meta-analyses [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 34" title="Perihan C, Burke M, Bowman-Perrott L, et al.

Only three trials were at low risk of bias, with the majority having ‘some concern’ and three studies were rated as at high risk of bias, mostly due to ‘reporting bias’. As the field of clinical trials advances further, the requirement to prospectively register study protocols should address the lack of clarity around whether trials have selectively published outcomes. Reporting bias is under-recognised and impacts on the interpretation of findings from clinical trials [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 75" title="Kirkham JJ, Dwan KM, Altman DG, Gamble C, Dodd S, Smyth R, Williamson PR.

Second, the large amount of heterogeneity in studies including clinician ratings could not be explained by the moderator analyses undertaken. This has made it difficult to explain treatment effects with available information about study and participant characteristics. The added detection of publication bias in these studies should also be viewed with caution. Third, we are unable to make any definitive conclusions about sustained improvement in symptoms beyond posttreatment effects because of the small numbers of studies analysed. It will be important for future trials to include this data so that durability of intervention gains can be fully explored. Most studies included in this meta-analysis also had small samples (the mean receiving CBT was 23 and controls 18) and were underpowered to detect even the largest effect size reported for clinicians. The current results suggest that the optimal number will vary depending upon which informant ratings are taken from. Finally, we acknowledge that our own review was not pre-registered, though all data have been made available with details of the search results itself (i.e. Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/10.1186/s40359-021-00658-8#Fig1">1</a>).</p></div></div></section><section data-title="Conclusions"><div class="c-article-section" id="Sec18-section"><h2 class="c-article-section__title js-section-title js-c-reading-companion-sections-item" id="Sec18">Conclusions</h2><div class="c-article-section__content" id="Sec18-content"><p>This study provides the largest meta-analysis (19 RCTs and 833 participants) to date on the efficacy of CBT for anxiety in children and adolescents on the autism spectrum. Our primary findings concur with previous reviews showing that CBT reduces anxiety in the immediate posttreatment period. Indeed, ratings by all three informant types were consistent in documenting a significant reduction of anxiety; and showed little or no evidence of publication bias. Nevertheless, the substantial variability in effect sizes across clinicians, parents and children would advise against future meta-analyses pooling across informants. It is notable that risk of bias was low except in the domain of reporting bias, where risk was generally higher. The latter seems to reflect the lack of preregistration of trials.</p><p>Recommendations for future trials include a focus on selecting autism-specific measures of anxiety or at least making necessary adaptions to scales; prospective registration of trials to overcome potential reporting biases; and the inclusion of follow-up analyses to assess whether treatment gains are sustained. We also note the absence of reporting on adverse events and the relative absence of health economic evaluation across trials, both of which are crucial to determine the wider value of the intervention beyond the reduction of symptomatology.</p></div></div></section>
