Search strategy and study selection
We searched Embase, Ovid MEDLINE, and APA PsycInfo data-
bases (via Ovid) for articles indexed up to July 2022, without lan-guage restrictions. The full search strategy is reported in onlineSupplementary File 1. We carried out an additional, post hoc,non-systematic search on Google Scholar to check whether add-itional studies were retrievable.

For example, the potency of cannabis in Europe has been reportedto have doubled from 8.9% tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) in2008 to over 17% THC in 2017, while cannabidiol (CBD) levelsremained stable (Chandra et al., 2019 ). No restrictions were
placed on participants age or publication language. Grey litera-ture, such as conference abstracts and dissertations were notexcluded from database searches (e.g. Web of Science CoreCollection). Additional sources of grey literature, such as govern-ment websites and clinical trial repositories, were not consideredfor this review due to the fact that randomized trials and organ-izational reports would not contain the type of data required for
this analysis. Case –control studies with less than ten matched-
pairs were excluded due to the increased risk of bias (RoB)encountered in studies with sample sizes below this threshold(Dekkers et al., 2019 ).

Rickwood and Bradford (2012) conducted a review of self-help only of mild anxiety disorders, the review was not limited to Randomised Controlled Trials (RCTs) and only contained 6 studies. Self-help programmes may also be effective in the treatment of childhood behaviour disorders (Baumel & Faber, in press; Montgomery, Bjornstad & Dennis, 2006; O’Brien & Daley, 2011). Again, these reviews have been specific and/or not restricted to self-help and guided self-help, for example Baumel and Faber (in press) reviewed the impact of technology-assisted parenting programmes for young people with disruptive behaviours.  The specificity of these previous reviews therefore reduces power to investigate potential moderating variables such as the type of self-help (paper versus online) or impact of guidance. Considering the type of self-help (such as computerised or bibliotherapy), has important implications for service development and delivery (e.g. computerised interventions may require provision of computers for those who do not have access at home and may be more expensive to produce in the short term), yet reviews to date have not investigated this as a moderating variable. Furthermore, while it has been assumed that young people prefer modern technology (e.g. Baumel & Faber, in press), it is not yet established whether this is in fact the case.  The specificity of previous reviews additionally reduces the ability to meta-analyse studies comparing self-help against standard face-to-face treatments as very few such studies exist for each mental health disorder in children. Such analysis is important given that the CYP-IAPT model is based on a stepped-care approach and that UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidance recommends guided self-help as a first step for intervention in some child mental health disorders (NICE, 2005). Face-to-face treatments differ in their efficacy, for example interventions for anxiety have demonstrated greater effect sizes than interventions for depression (e.g. Spek et al., 2007). Therefore, it may be that self-help is similar in efficacy to some face-to-face interventions but has small effect sizes when compared to no treatment (and therefore may not be a preferred option for commissioners) and conversely, there may be self-help treatments that do not compare favourably to face-to-face treatments but nevertheless are efficacious in comparison to no treatment and therefore suitable to be used in a stepped-care approach. Knowledge of patient characteristics that affect efficacy, including whether they meet diagnostic criteria, would then support decisions regarding which patients are entered into which ‘step’ in such a care pathway.  Self-help in children and adolescents: A meta-analysis   
5		Adult reviews have increased power through combining studies of interventions for anxiety and depression (e.g. Cuijpers, Donker, Van Straten, Li & Andersson, 2010) due to high rates of comorbidity between the conditions (Andrews, Slade & Issakidis, 2002) as well as the presence of transdiagnostic interventions designed to treat both anxiety and depression (e.g. Andrews, Cuijpers, Craske, McEvoy & Titov, 2010). Similarly, children and young people tend to have multiple comorbidities, with 40% having more than one diagnosis (Merikangas et al., 2010) and high rates of comorbidity amongst the most common childhood mental health disorders (anxiety, depression and disruptive behaviour disorders). There are child interventions designed to treat comorbid mood and conduct problems (e.g. the Modular Approach to Therapy for Children with Anxiety, Depression, Trauma, or Conduct Problems - MATCH-ADTC; Chorpita & Weisz, 2009) and some child studies have investigated the impact on behaviour interventions on mood and vice versa (e.g. Baker, Sanders, Turner & Morawska, 2017). However, no child reviews to date have combined interventions for anxiety, depression and disruptive behaviour disorders.  This review therefore combines interventions for anxiety, depression and disruptive behaviour in order to investigate possible moderating variables.  An understanding of important moderating variables and user satisfaction of interventions may support the development of guidance regarding self-help programmes for children and young people. In particular, it could support services to decide which of the very many self-help interventions to recommend as they roll out self-help as part of stepped-care.    Objectives The main aim of this review is to systematically assess the evidence-base for the use of unguided self-help and guided self-help for children and young people with symptoms of common mental health disorders (symptoms of anxiety, depression and/or disruptive behaviour). Within this, the objectives are to: 1) Evaluate the efficacy of unguided self-help and guided self-help interventions for symptoms of common mental health disorders in children and adolescents.  2) Compare the effectiveness of unguided self-help and guided self-help interventions to standard face-to face interventions for common mental health disorders in children. 3) Evaluate whether the presence and/or type of guidance given is associated with outcome. Self-help in children and adolescents: A meta-analysis   
6		4) Determine whether type and severity of mental health disorder is associated with outcome. 5) Assess treatment acceptability of unguided and guided self-help for children and young people.  Methods Identification and selection of studies  Search methods Two reviewers independently conducted searches and assessed them for inclusion. Disagreements were resolved through discussion with a third reviewer.  Databases EMBASE, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, CINAHL and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials databases were searched from inception to 11th February 2018. In addition, grey literature searches were conducted through searching the PsycExtra and WorldCat Theses and Dissertations databases. We also searched for trial registrations through clinicaltrials.gov and WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform. Citation searches and searches of reference lists of identified papers were also completed. Reference lists of previous reviews were also examined. Additional literature was sought through personal contact with researchers in the area. No restrictions were placed on publication date or language.  Inclusion Criteria Study type To minimise bias, only RCTs were included in the search.  Participants Children up to the age of 18 years, with no lower age limit. Studies with mixed samples including young adults to 25 years old were included, provided the mean age of the sample was under 18 years old.  It was acceptable for the intervention to be undertaken primarily with parents, provided that child outcomes were reported. Children must have had impairing psychiatric symptoms, of depression, anxiety and/or disruptive behaviour, assessed through a measure of symptoms such Self-help in children and adolescents: A meta-analysis   
7		as the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (Goodman, 1997), a diagnostic instrument, such as the Anxiety Disorders Interview Schedule – Child/Parent (Silverman & Albano, 1996) or self/parent reported difficulties.  Interventions Self-help interventions, including bibliotherapy and computerised therapy were included. Guided self-help interventions were included in the review, provided that the main aim of the intervention was ‘self-help’ and that the guidance was restricted to supporting children and/or parents through the programme rather than teaching new materials. Studies that evaluated interventions in which the guided self-help was a part of the intervention (blended treatments with face-to-face psychotherapy and some guided self-help elements) were excluded.  Comparators Trials with any control group (waiting list, treatment as usual, placebo/attention control or other) were included, as well as with another psychological treatment. Studies which reported insufficient data for the effect size to be calculated were excluded.  Outcome Measures Outcome measures were any measure related to mental health, such as standardised measures for depression, anxiety, or disruptive behaviour, or diagnostic interviews. The measure had to relate to the mental health of the child and not the parent/carer, although parent-reports of child health/behaviour were acceptable. Qualitative results from measures of treatment acceptability were also extracted where available.   Search terms Search terms including MeSH terms were divided into three main areas: self-help, intervention, and mental health disorder, and the areas combined with the AND operator. See Appendix A for full list of search terms. Searches were developed and conducted in collaboration with a librarian (GM).   Data extraction and management Data extraction was completed independently by two raters for each paper and disagreements were resolved by discussion with a third reviewer. Data were extracted on a range of Self-help in children and adolescents: A meta-analysis   
8		variables: participant characteristics, intervention characteristics and study design characteristics, using a pre-designed data extraction form. Study design Data were extracted regarding the comparator (face-to-face, attention, waiting list, treatment as usual, medication) and the target condition (anxiety, depression, disruptive behaviour, or mixed). Length of follow-up (where present) was also determined. We also categorised studies reporting Intention to Treat (ITT) versus those which did not (yes/no).  Participant characteristics Studies were categorised into child (all participants 13 years old or younger), adolescent (participants all older than 13 years old) or mixed studies. Data on mean age and percentage of males were also extracted, in addition to whether participants met diagnostic criteria for the primary mental health disorder using a validated diagnostic measure (yes/no).  Intervention characteristics We extracted data regarding: whether the intervention was unguided or guided self-help (guidance yes/no) and how the self-help was delivered (written materials/computer/mixed/other).  Assessment of risk of bias in included studies Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool (Higgins et al., 2011). 10% of studies were rated by a second independent rater. Disagreements were resolved through discussion with a third independent reviewer. This tool assesses selection bias (including random sequence generation and allocation concealment), blinding of participants and personnel, blinding of outcome assessment (considered at the individual outcome measure level), attrition bias/incomplete outcome data and selective reporting. Regarding blinding of outcome measures, self-report measures were considered at low risk of bias for the purposes of this review. Regarding selective reporting, studies were considered to be at low risk only if there was a study registration or published protocol and the outcomes in the paper matched those pre-specified. We examined the relationship between risk of bias and the effect size by performing meta-regression techniques. In these analyses, the total bias score was entered as the dependent variable. We compared the effect sizes of studies rated as low-risk of bias (all domains evaluated as being at low risk of bias) compared to studies with some risk of bias (one or more domains evaluated as being at unclear or high risk of bias).  Self-help in children and adolescents: A meta-analysis   
9		 Meta-analysis Measurement of treatment effect Separate analyses were conducted for studies using control groups and those comparing against face-to-face interventions. Many studies failed to specify a primary outcome measure and therefore multiple measures were used for several studies. This is particularly the case for behaviour interventions. Only measures that directly related to child outcomes were included, however; measures of parenting practices or parenting self-efficacy were not assessed.  In cases in which multiple measures were reported, no one measure was prioritised. Instead, we combined the results of all measures.  We calculated Hedges’ g for each study outcome, which is the standardised mean difference adjusting for small sample sizes. We used the endpoint score only. Where two or more measures were used per outcome (e.g. depression), the pooled effect sizes were calculated in order to include only one effect size per study in the analysis. Only measures relating to the primary outcome of the disorder were used to generate mean effect sizes (e.g. only measures of depressive symptomatology for a study of a depression intervention). To calculate pooled mean effect sizes, we used Comprehensive Meta-Analysis (CMA) software Version 3 (Biostat, Inc.). A random-effects pooling model was used in all analyses. We transformed standardised mean differences into the Number Needed to Treat (NNT; the number of patients that must be treated to generate one additional positive outcome) using the Kraemer and Kupfer (2006) formula.  We conducted a series of subgroup analyses, according to the mixed effects model. In this model, studies within subgroups are pooled with the random-effects model, whilst tests for significant differences between subgroups are conducted with the fixed-effects model (Borenstein, Hedges, Higgins & Rothstein, 2009). For continuous variables, we used random effects method of moments meta-regression analyses to test whether a significant relationship existed between the continuous variable and the effect size, as indicated by a Z value and associated p-values.  We aimed to analyse the following subgroups: • Different diagnoses (anxiety, depression and disruptive behaviour). • Different types of self-help (bibliotherapy versus computerised). • Different amounts of guidance (i.e. self-help versus guided self-help).

Moreover, it will allow us to answer three theoretically and practically important questions. First, overall, how effective are social identification-building interventions in improving health? Second, to what extent, and how, do different types of interventions vary in effectiveness? Third, to what extent, and how, do interventions vary in their capacity to deliver different kinds of health outcomes?  The Present Research Despite the growing interest in social identification and health, no attempt has been made to provide a systematic quantitative synthesis of intervention studies that build social identification with a view to improving health. In light of emerging applications of the social identity approach to health, this is a significant shortcoming. The need for such analysis is also warranted by the growing use of interventions delivered in a group format (Borek, Abraham, Greaves, & Tarrant, 2018; Swancutt, Tarrant, & Pinkney, 2019) — a method which itself raises questions about the role that social (i.e., group) identification plays in supporting and enhancing participants’ health. In these various ways, a meta-analysis of intervention studies not only constitutes a robust test of underlying theoretical principles of the social identity approach to health but also has practical utility for both health practitioners and policymakers. In view of these considerations, the present research seeks to provide a systematic review of social identification-building interventions to improve health. This takes the form of a meta-analysis that estimates both the summary effect size and variability in effectiveness. Following best-practice recommendations for systematic reviews and meta-analysis, the reporting of the meta-analysis includes the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA; Liberati et al., 2009) and includes the information recommended by the Meta-Analysis Reporting Methods (MARS; Appelbaum et Meta-Analysis of Social Identification-Building Interventions to Improve Health 
	10 al., 2018), while the reporting of the study protocol follows the PRISMA-P guidelines (Moher et al., 2015). The PRISMA and PRISMA-P statements are available as supplementary materials online. Method Preregistration  Following best practice guidelines (Stewart, Moher, & Shekelle, 2012; see also Moher et al., 2015) and to contribute to reproducible science and enhance confidence in findings by reducing bias, the protocol for the present meta-analysis was prospectively registered on PROSPERO before data extraction and analysis [http://www.crd.york.ac.uk/PROSPERO/display_record.php?ID=CRD42018092834]. The data and analysis code are included as supplementary materials for review and are available on the Open Science Framework: https://osf.io/mpw5j/?view_only=b092ab3d41024235b378ee51f35e0f15). We followed the pre-registered study protocol in conducting the research by adhering to the inclusion criteria, the coding of the studies, and the analysis strategy as specified in advance. In what follows, we report the planned summary effect analyses to estimate the overall mean effect and heterogeneity indices. The included studies are further described by providing summary mean effect for each intervention type and each outcome category.  Eligibility Criteria To be included in the meta-analysis, studies had to fulfil the following criteria: (a) have an intervention design (i.e., a single-group pre-post-intervention design, an independent-groups post-intervention design, or an independent-groups pre-post-intervention design), (b) be conducted in an applied context (e.g., in a community, health/ clinical, educational, or organizational setting), (c) include a measure of social identification with a specific group/collective relevant to the intervention, (d) report quantitative statistics on the impact of Meta-Analysis of Social Identification-Building Interventions to Improve Health 
	11 the intervention using at least one indicator of health or well-being, and (e) be reported in English. Studies were excluded if they used other designs (e.g., cross-sectional, prospective, or observational), were conducted in the laboratory, included only a measure of social connectedness or identification in a general sense (e.g., not with the specific group that the intervention targeted or with groups in general) but not social identification with a group that the intervention targeted, or had assessed the impact of the intervention only on variables other than health.  Search Strategy The various steps of the systematic literature search process are presented in Figure 1. Two members (the first two authors) of the review team independently conducted all steps of the literature search (any discrepancies were resolved through discussion). We used several search strategies to maximize the chance of capturing all relevant work. We conducted a search using the databases Web of Science Core Collection and PubMed to retrieve relevant published work, and ERIC, ProQuest Dissertations, and Theses Global to retrieve relevant unpublished work (grey literature). Prior to pre-registering the study, the research team considered and discussed at length the various databases in the development of the study design and conducted a scoping review of potentially relevant databases and keywords. The scoping review revealed that Web of Science covered a large proportion of potentially relevant outlets across disciplines (including social and life sciences) while PubMed covered a large proportion of potentially relevant outlets particularly from the medical and health sciences. It is our sense that, together with the use of ProQuest Dissertations and Thesis Global to identify potential unpublished literature and a call for unpublished data, this ensured that the study search was comprehensive in capturing potentially relevant studies.  In addition, with the aim of ensuring comprehensiveness of the search strategy, we used various keywords that revealed a large number of hits. We devised the search terms with Meta-Analysis of Social Identification-Building Interventions to Improve Health 
	12 the aim of (a) using terms that were sensitive to the target field by maximising the chance of capturing potentially relevant studies, while minimizing the number of false negatives and (b) capturing the diverse nature of studies and their diverse foci to identify as many as possible potentially relevant studies. For the sake of consistency, we used the same parameters across the three databases (we did not use other database-specific search methods such as MeSH type subject headings offered by PubMed). We used the search terms to identify articles in the databases that contained any of the following search terms in the article’s title and/ or abstract: [(intervention OR experiment* OR treatment OR therapy OR program OR programme) AND (""social identi*"" OR ""group identi*"" OR ""organi?ational identi*"" OR ""work* identi*"" OR ""team identi*"" OR ""club identi*"" OR “school identi*” OR ""crowd identi*"") AND (health* OR well-being OR wellbeing OR depression OR anxiety OR stress OR quality of life OR life satisfaction)]. A detailed description of the search process including the exact search terms used for each data base are provided in the PROSPERO pre-registration document (see Supplementary Materials). The search was conducted (last updated) on 28 March 2019.  This search yielded a total of 2,744 records, of which 349 were duplicates leaving a total of 2,395 unique records. Each coder (X & Y, anonymized for the sake of the review process) separately screened titles and abstracts of all 2,395 unique records with the view to determining the article’s potential to include relevant data (deciding whether to include or exclude in the subsequent full-text screen). The coders agreed in their judgment in 2,220 out of 2,395 articles (92.7%), indicating high levels of agreement. To maximize the likelihood of including a potentially relevant record, all records that were coded by only one judge as potentially relevant were included in the next phase of the full-text screening. In the second phase, each coder then independently conducted a full-text screen of the selected set of articles that the previous phase identified to determine whether (or not) these fulfilled the Meta-Analysis of Social Identification-Building Interventions to Improve Health 
	13 inclusion criteria. The coders agreed in 96.8% (274 out of 283) of all articles, indicating a high degree of inter-reliability. The coders discussed cases of disagreement and arrived at a consensus about how best to deal with these. The full-text screening of these 283 records yielded a total of 20 records that fulfilled the inclusion criteria. In addition, we sent out calls for data to the European Association of Social Psychology, who publish the European Journal of Social Psychology where an edited Special Issue on the ‘Social Cure’ appeared in 2017, and to participants who attended the 4th International Conference on Social Identity and Health (ICSIH4; Desrichard et al., 2018; N ≈ 80). This yielded five additional relevant records, resulting in a total of 25 records reporting 27 independent samples (56 effect sizes, N = 2,230) that met the inclusion criteria (full references of all included data can be found in the supplementary materials online).  Data Extraction The final sample of included studies is presented in Table 2. The first and second author of the present work extracted all data and resolved any discrepancies through discussion. The following information was extracted: authors, title, date of publication, study population description, participant demographics, sample size, study design, intervention description, delivery format, outcome measure, social identification measure, risk of bias characteristics, and effect size statistics.  To calculate each effect size, we extracted means, standard deviations, and sample size. Following recommendations from Borenstein, Morris, and colleagues (Borenstein, Hedges, Higgins, & Rothstein, 2009; Morris, 2008; Morris & DeShon, 2002), we calculated a common effect size metric in the form of standardized mean difference to allow for comparable effect size estimations across studies. For independent-groups post-intervention designs (that employed only one post-intervention measurement) we used the following formula (Morris & DeShon, 2002): !""#=	&'()*,,-&'()*,./0'()*,1 , where 23456 is the sample mean Meta-Analysis of Social Identification-Building Interventions to Improve Health 
	14 post-intervention for the treatment and control group, respectively, and 783456,9 is the pooled within group standard deviation of post-intervention scores. For designs employing pre-and-post measures we used the pooled pre-intervention standard deviation as the denominator for the effect size calculation, because this is not influenced by the intervention and provides more accurate estimations that are more comparable across studies (Morris, 2008). For independent-groups pre-post-intervention designs we used the following formula (Morris, 2008): !""#99=	&'()*,,-&':;,,-(&'()*,.-&':;,.)/0':;,1, where 23456 is the sample mean post-intervention and 23>? is the sample mean pre-intervention (for the treatment and control group), and 783>?,9 is the pooled pre-intervention standard deviation. For single-group pre-post intervention designs we used the following formula (Morris & DeShon, 2002): !/#99=	&'()*,,-&':;,,/0':;,, , where 783>?,@ is the pre-intervention standard deviation. Finally, to account for the positive bias of Cohen’s d, we applied Hedges correction factor to each effect size using the following formula (Hedges, 1981): A=1−	DEFG-H where !I is the degrees of freedom.  Focal Analysis We conducted all analyses using R open-source software (version 3.5.0) and the package metafor (Viechtbauer, 2010). Some studies reported multiple outcomes, so to account for dependency between effect sizes, we conducted a three-level meta-analytic model (Moeyaert et al., 2017; Van den Noortgate, López-López, Marín-Martínez, & Sánchez-Meca, 2015). The three-level model extends the two-level (univariate) random-effects model by specifying random effects at both level 2 (to each effect size within a study) and level 3 (the mean effect size at the study level). The three-level model estimates the sampling variance for each effect size (level 1), the within-study variance (level 2), and the between-study variance (level 3) and combines regression equations at each level in a three-level meta-Meta-Analysis of Social Identification-Building Interventions to Improve Health ",YES,"The scoping review revealed that Web of Science covered a large proportion of potentially relevant outlets across disciplines (including social and life sciences) while PubMed covered a large proportion of potentially relevant outlets particularly from the medical and health sciences.

Articles were excluded if they were (1) qualitative studies, (2), intervention studies, (3) review articles or dissertations and (4) included women with a family history of breast cancer or those recalled for screening due to abnormal results.  Method of Quality assessment Quality assessment was undertaken independently by two reviewers using a published tool comprising of a checklist developed to assess the quality of the reporting of methods, results, and conclusions of quantitative studies over a wide range of designs including observational research designs (Kmet, Lee, & Cook, 2004). Three of the 14 items were removed as they were not relevant to the included studies. These were specific to intervention studies, concerned with random allocation to treatment and control groups, blinding of investigators and subjects to the treatment/control group. Items were assigned either a rating of 2 (criteria fulfilled), 1 (criteria partially fulfilled), or 0 (criteria not fulfilled). A summary score was calculated as the total score out of a total possible score of 22. High quality papers were defined as scoring 17 or above (77% of possible score), moderate quality between 11 and 16 (50 – 76%), and low-quality papers were those with scores below 10 (<50%). As all studies were at least of moderate quality a decision was taken to weight all studies equally. Data extraction The following data were extracted by the first author for each article: authors, year of publication, country where study conducted, factors associated with help-seeking or screening behaviour (including health beliefs, and clinical or health factors), sample size, study design, population and setting, and use of theoretical models. Main outcomes were (1) screening attendance (including % of uptake of screening) and (2) help-seeking behaviour (length of time from symptom to contacting a healthcare professional. A narrative review was conducted Running head: Help-seeking and screening for breast cancer symptoms 9 
  synthesising results of the studies (Table_S2).  Issues with extraction  Although standard BMI categories were used across studies (BMI <18.5 kg/m2 as underweight, >18.5 kg/m² and <24.9 kg/m² as healthy weight, >25 kg/m2 and < 29.9 kg/m2 as overweight, and BMI >30 kg/m² as obese) there was variability in how BMI was reported across studies (e.g. dichotomised variable as obese/non-obese; reported weight categories underweight/healthy weight/overweight/obese); reported waist circumference). This is a limitation therefore in that some studies may have included underweight, healthy weight, and overweight participants within a non-obese category whereas other studies excluded underweight participants from the non-obese category. Strategy for meta-analysis A meta-analysis using Comprehensive Meta-Analysis software (V3 Biostat Inc. 2016) was undertaken focusing on the following factors associated with screening intention or behaviour: health factors (body mass index (BMI), physical activity, smoking, diet); previous screening behaviour; health insurance; and health beliefs. Due to the limited number of studies examining factors associated with help-seeking behaviour, analyses were undertaken for only two factors associated with help-seeking: symptom type and fear of being diagnosed with breast cancer. Effect sizes were reported as the Standard Mean Difference (either extracted directly from the paper, or converted from a reported odds ratio, regression coefficient, or calculated if enough data was reported in the study). The meta-analysis was based on a random effects model, which assumes that there is heterogeneity in populations between studies. Publication bias was addressed by the examination of funnel plots and use of the trim and fill method (Duval & Tweedie, 2000b). Tests for homogeneity were conducted using the I2 statistic (the proportion of the observed variance which would remain if the sampling error could be removed; Borenstein, Hedges, Higgins, & Rothstein, 2009). Low heterogeneity was signified Running head: Help-seeking and screening for breast cancer symptoms 10 
  by values of 25% and below, moderate heterogeneity 50% and high heterogeneity indicated by an I2 value greater than 75% (Higgins, Thompson, Deeks, & Altman, 2003). Methodological rigour Bias in review design was reduced through the careful design of the research question and predetermination of the inclusion and exclusion criteria. A protocol for this systematic review was developed prior to commencement of the review and reviewed and registered on an international database of prospectively registered systematic reviews in health and social care (PROSPERO ID=CRD42016032618). Although the search was limited to the English Language and to studies published since 2005, we aimed to reduce bias in locating studies through searching multiple databases (CINAHL, MEDLINE, PSYCINFO, SCOPUS, and ASSIA). Furthermore, the review did not include a search of the grey literature however, it did include backwards (reference) and forward (citation) searches of the included papers to identify any additional relevant papers. In order to reduce bias in selecting studies as a result of personal bias introduced by a single person screening to select studies, this review utilised two reviewers. They independently screened titles and abstracts of the articles for inclusion before the screening of the full-text articles by the first reviewer. Both reviewers provided assessment of the quality of the included papers using the checklist described in the methods section. A third reviewer was then involved in discussion over ambiguous studies and the decision of whether to include or exclude articles where there was disagreement between the first two reviewers.  Finally, bias in synthesising studies can occur as the result of selective reporting where the review authors present only a selection of outcomes or associated factors based on their statistical significance following analysis. The factors influencing help-seeking behaviour examined in this review were predetermined prior to the commencement of the review and Running head: Help-seeking and screening for breast cancer symptoms 11 
  included multiple factors (health beliefs, and clinical or health factors), rather limiting to a single factor.  Results (Figure 1 here) 4580 unique papers were identified (Figure 1). Following screening of titles, abstracts and full-text articles, 65 relevant studies were included in this review. Fifty-seven studies examined screening attendance, seven studies examined help-seeking behaviour, and one study reported both help-seeking and screening behaviours. Data were reported from 17 European countries with the majority (17 studies) originating in Turkey, followed by Spain (9 studies), the UK (7 studies), and France (7 studies). There was a total of 263,263 participants across studies (two studies did not report sample size) and 27 of the studies analysed secondary data. There were 19 studies (29%) which utilised theoretical models (Table_S2). This was predominantly the Health Belief Model used in 15 of the screening studies. Five studies (8%) were rated as moderate quality with the remaining 60 studies (92%) rated as high quality. Summary results are displayed in Table_S2 with a full breakdown of the scores in Table_S3.  Narrative synthesis Screening attendance. The most common outcomes reported in the screening studies were having a mammogram within the last two years (21 studies), having had at least one mammogram (19 studies), and attendance at screening over a particular time period (13 studies). Screening attendance ranged from 5% to 96%. Most of the screening studies (77%) included participants who were over the age of 40 (range 16 to over 75, reflecting that invitations for screening in the countries included occur between the ages of 40-50 until 65-74 (Giordano et al., 2012). Thirteen of the screening studies (22%) were taken from mammography attendance records whereas 45 (78%) used self-report data. Running head: Help-seeking and screening for breast cancer symptoms 12 
  Help-seeking. Average time to presentation ranged between 7 days (median) (Koo et al., 2017) to 6 weeks (mean) (Jassem et al., 2014). The proportion of study participants seeking help within thirty days was between 60% (Gözüm & Tuzcu, 2018) (Gözüm & Tuzcu, 2018) and 70% (O’Mahony et al., 2013). Between 9% (Koo et al., 2017) and 42% (Burgess et al., (2006) had a time to presentation of over 90 days.   Factors associated with screening attendance and help-seeking behaviour were divided into three categories: health behaviours; healthcare utilisation; and knowledge and beliefs. Figures 2-4 illustrate the factors associated with both behaviours and the number of studies which were associated with a higher level of screening or prompt help-seeking, and the number of studies associated with lower screening attendance or a longer time to presentation. Table_S4 lists the studies included for each factor (Figure 2 here)  (Figure 3 here) (Figure 4 here)  In the only study reporting both on help-seeking and screening behaviours (Jassem et al., 2014), the countries in which screening attendance rates were higher tended to also report more prompt help-seeking. For example, in Poland screening attendance was 82% and mean help-seeking time was 3.61 weeks, whereas in Romania, screening attendance was 22% and mean help-seeking time was 6.02 weeks.  Meta-analysis Meta-analyses were conducted for health behaviour and health belief factors associated with screening (Table_S5-S7). Funnel plots were assessed visually (Table_S8) and combined with the Trim and Fill method (Duval & Tweedie, 2000a, 2000b). Never having had cervical screening (d=-0.72, p<0.001) and perceiving higher barriers to mammography (d=-0.40, Running head: Help-seeking and screening for breast cancer symptoms 13 
  p<0.001) were significantly associated with lower mammography screening attendance. Having health insurance (d=0.49, p<0.001), greater perceived benefits (d=0.31, p<0.001) and motivation towards mammography (d=0.36, p=0.003), and higher perceived seriousness (d=0.24, p=0.019) and greater perceived susceptibility towards breast cancer (d=0.20, p=0.024) were significantly associated with a higher level of screening attendance. Although statistically significant; obesity (d=-0.08, p=0.005), being a current smoker (d=-0.11, p=0.025), and exercising (d=0.18, p<0.001) were not of a sufficient effect size (>=0.2) to have confidence in the difference in effect between groups being tested (Cohen, 1992). Due to limited data, meta-analyses were undertaken for only two factors associated with help-seeking behaviour. Presenting with a symptom other than a lump was associated with a longer time to presentation (d=0.32, p<0.001); while fear of being diagnosed with breast cancer was non-significant.  Six of the meta-analyses required use of the Trim and Fill method resulting in an altered effect size which adjusted for the effect of potential publication bias (Table_S4). The results of the publication bias and subsequent adjustments should be treated cautiously however, due to the small number of studies included within each meta-analysis (Borenstein et al., 2009). All meta-analyses had significant heterogeneity in results which would warrant further investigation. Due to the small number of studies included in each meta-analysis, analysis of potential moderators was not possible.  Discussion The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to identify health behaviour and health belief factors associated with breast cancer screening attendance and help-seeking for symptoms of breast cancer among women in Europe. Results from the meta-analyses suggest that having private health insurance, having had cervical screening and positive health beliefs (e.g. motivation and perceived benefits) are significantly associated with a higher level of breast cancer screening attendance.

Literature search and data extraction. Our data collection strategy involved  
(1) a search of the relevant existing literature reviews and the studies referenced in them, (2) string-based searches of bibliographic databases and (3) searches of grey literature on Google. In accordance with the guidance on rigorous evidence syntheses, we searched a broad set of bibliographic databases (Web of Science Core Collections Citation Indexes, Scopus, JSTOR, MEDLINE) and the web-based academic search engine Google Scholar, based on a comprehensive search string. The Web of Science Core Collection Citation Indexes included in our search were as follows: Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-Expanded) – 1900 to present, Social Sciences Citation Index (SSCI) – 1900 to present, Arts & Humanities Citation Index (A&HCI) – 1975 to present, Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S) – 1990 to present, Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH) – 1990 to present, Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI) – 2015 to present.
We developed a search string that followed the PICOS (population, 
intervention, comparator, outcome and study design) logic recommended by the Campbell Collaboration (Supplementary Table 1). The search string was developed iteratively by checking the results of the search against a set of studies of known relevance. We searched for articles that dealt with household energy (or electricity) consumption along with one or more of the interventions of interest (see Supplementary Table 2 for the inclusion/exclusion criteria). We only tagged as relevant studies that dealt with the energy consumption of households or dormitories and contained a quantitative estimate of the energy saved through a relevant intervention. We did not include studies that focused on price effects but only referenced load effects (changes in kW and not kWh) or those that only reported the effect on peak consumption and not total consumption. Studies that only provided an effect size but not the associated variance were not included in the final synthesis. In addition, studies in which no obvious comparator group was available (untreated control group or pre-intervention data) or in which the sample size was too small to extract meaningful estimates were excluded from the analysis. Studies that only measured the energy consumption of certain appliances or the direct load control of appliances by utilities were not considered. We reviewed quantitative studies aimed at behaviours for reducing energy demand mainly by leveraging the use and maintenance of existing equipment in residences and not by the adoption of long-lasting structural changes that reduce carbon emissions, such as energy-efficient appliances, building insulation and switching to green sources of energy, such as installing solar panels or switching to a greener supplier, although three of the included studies involved the provision of information/tips to households for reducing energy consumption through both home improvements and behavioural changes (Supplementary Table 7). Excluding these studies from the analysis did not materially change the results.

PRESENTED AT AIDS 2022 -THE 24TH INTERNATIONAL AIDS CONFERENCE | MONTREAL, CANADALaioMagno1,2, Marcos Pereira2,Caroline Tianezede Castro2,Thais AranhaRossi1,LayllaMirella GalvãoAzevedo3, InêsDourado2 1Universidade do Estado da Bahia, Departamentode Ciênciasda Vida, Salvador, Brazil,2Universidade Federal da Bahia, Institutode SaúdeColetiva, Salvador, Brazil,3Universidade Federal do Oesteda Bahia, Escola de Medicina, Barreiras, BrazilBackground§HIV testing is the gateway to antiretroviral therapy for people living with HIV (PLWH);§Men who have sex with men (MSM) and transgender women (TGW) still face several barriers to HIV testing. Goal§We aimed to investigate the effectiveness of strategies and types of tests on HIV testing uptake among men who have sex with men (MSM) and transgender women (TGW), and in reaching the PLWH of this population. Additionally, we investigated barriers and facilitators to HIV testing.Methods§A systematic review and meta-analysis were performed according to the PRISMA and registered in the PROSPERO, CRD42020192740 (Figure 1);§The guiding question of the review was: “Which strategies for offering HIV testing are most effective to reach TGW and MSM living with HIV?”§Articles published up to July 2020 were identified using PubMed, Bireme, Scopus, Web of Science, Science Direct, SciELO, LILACS electronic databases, and the grey literature (i.e., Google Scholar, Dissertation and Thesis Catalog of the Brazilian Coordination for the Improvement of Higher Education Personnel, and Proquest); §Observational, intervention, and mixed studies that implemented HIV testing strategies for MSM and TGW were included;§Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) and the Health Sciences Descriptors (DeCS) andwere combined with Boolean operator AND, whereas their synonyms were combined with Boolean operator OR (i.e., HIV testing, HIV, AIDS, MSM, and TGW and transsexual people); §The outcomevariableswere HIV testing uptake, the prevalence of HIV infection, and detection of new HIV diagnoses;§We also used a random-effects meta-analysis to pool estimates with respective 95% confidence intervals (95%CI), and Cochran’s Q test and I² to evaluate heterogeneity. §Data were extracted from published articles and assessed the risk of bias.
Results§A total of 6,820 references were selected, and 263 included in the review (n= 67,288 participants);§Most studies included in this research were from high-income countries;§Regarding the testing strategies, 71.2% of the studies used community-and 28.8% facility-based testing (Figure 2);§The following tests were used: rapid test (24.0%), self-test (22.1%), multiple test combinations (14.4%), standard laboratory test (2.7%), and urine test (0.4%) (Figure 3);§Figure 4 shows the temporal trend of publications using different type of tests; and Figure 5 shows the risk of bias across the studies.§A higher uptake occurred in the facility-based testing strategy. The prevalence of HIV infection and the detection of new HIV diagnoses are shown in Table 1 by study groups;§Standard laboratory test had the highest uptake for MSM and multiple test combinations for TGW (Table 2);§Standard laboratory test showed the highest HIV infection prevalence among MSM and multiple test combinations among TGW (Table 2); §Urine test detected the highest rate of new HIV diagnosis detection for MSM and multiple test combinations for TGW;§Psychosocial and structural factors, such as stigma, and fear of positive test results, were the main barriers to HIV testing.Conclusions§Facility-based testing was the strategy with the highest uptake and reached more PLWH; §Standard laboratory tests had the highest uptake and HIV prevalence among MSM, although the urine test achieved the highest rate of new HIV infections; §Multiple test combinations had the highest uptake and reached more PLWH among TGW;§Multiple test combinations may represent an important strategy to reach key populations that are difficult to access, as they offer autonomy of choice.§Our study shows that it is important to consider a diversity of testing strategies, considering barriers and regional aspects, with different types of testing to increase uptake and to achieve PLWH between MSM and TGW.TheauthorsacknowledgethefinancialsupportfromtheDepartmentofChronicDiseasesandSexuallyTransmittedInfections(DCCI)oftheBrazilianMinistryofHealthandtheNationalCouncilforScientificandTechnologicalDevelopment(CNPQ)(Project#443116/2019-9).Acknowledgment and Funding

We included observational studies (cross-sectional stud-

If astudy addressed children and adolescents, it was included if datafor age-based subgroups were available. Rarity was defined asaffecting less than one in 2000 individuals. We included diseaseswith a primarily genetic origin since we aimed at investigatingchronic rather than acute conditions. Therefore, we excluded rarecancers, injuries, infections, complications after medical interven-tions and somatoform diseases. We further excluded studies asses-sing rare sub-forms of non-rare diseases (e.g. early-onset Parkinsondisease) and gen-carriers without the clinical picture of the disease.

214  Dependent and Moderating Variables Cognitive and affective educational outcomes were the dependent variables used in this study. Cognitive outcomes include measures such as learning, achievement, critical thinking skills, comprehension, and similar outcomes. The affective outcomes included learner satisfaction, emotions, attitudes, motivation, and related measures. Though it was our intention to also code for behavioral educational outcomes, only two studies reported on behavioral outcome and hence this was not part of this meta-analysis. Several variables important in SOL were coded and examined as moderators. Though we coded for a number of variables, there was not sufficient information to examine all as moderators. Thus, only seven were chosen: two pedagogical (course duration and type of instructional method),  one methodological (student equivalence), three demographic (learner level, discipline, country), and one publication type variable (publication source). Moderators included: (a) course duration (i.e., less than one semester or one semester and more); (b) type of instructional method (i.e., lecture or interactive lesson); (c) student equivalence (i.e., non-random assignment or random assignment); (d) learner level (i.e., undergraduate or graduate/professional); (e) discipline (i.e., education or others); (f) country (i.e., United States of America or others); and (g) publication source (i.e., journal article or dissertation). Effect Size Calculation and Data Analysis Data were analyzed using the computer software Comprehensive Meta-Analysis, version 3 (CMA 3.0; Borenstein et al., 2014). Effect size used in the current meta-analysis was Hedges’ g. First, standardized mean difference (Cohen’s d) was calculated by dividing the raw mean difference between the synchronous treatment condition and the control condition (asynchronous or face-to-face condition) by the pooled standard deviation of the two conditions using the following formula. Notations were borrowed from Borenstein et al. (2009). d = !""!#	!""""%#$%&$'                                                                      (1) !&'()'* = ""(*!#,)∗%!""/(*""#,)∗%""""*!/*""#0                                                      (2) Then ! was transformed into Hedges’s g for bias correction using the following formula (Borenstein et al., 2009).  g = (1-12∗34#,)*d                                                            (3) We have three types of effect size statistics. Most studies reported statistics of means, standard deviations, and sample sizes for the synchronous treatment condition and the control condition (i.e., asynchronous or face-to-face). One study reported raw mean difference and significance of difference (i.e., Cleveland-Innes & Ally, 2004) and one study reported Cohen’s d (i.e., Francescucci & Rohani, 2019). The original data had 86 cases of effect size statistics in the 19 primary studies. Before conducting the meta-analysis, we had to A Meta-Analysis on the Effects of Synchronous Online Learning on Cognitive and Affective Educational Outcomes Martin, Sun, Turk, and Ritzhaupt  
215  deal with statistics that may have yielded dependent effect sizes within studies. For example, Peterson et al. (2018) reported multiple effect size statistics calculated from different affective measures. Ignoring the dependence issue would pose threats to validity of meta-analytic results because it may result in a spuriously smaller standard error of the summary effect size and a higher risk of committing type I error (Ahn et al., 2012). Literature suggested procedures in handling the dependence such as averaging or weighted averaging method (Borenstein et al., 2009) or robust variance estimation (RVE) (Hedges et al., 2010). Although RVE performs better than the averaging procedure in estimating unbiased standard error (Moeyaert et al., 2017), it requires a large sample (i.e., number of primary studies) for accuracy (Tanner-Smith & Tipton, 2014). Therefore, we used the weight averaging procedure to deal with the dependence issue. This resulted in 27 effect sizes in the 19 primary studies after we averaged effect size statistics of the same measure type (i.e., affective or cognitive) for each control group (i.e., asynchronous or face-to-face) within studies. We employed a random-effects model for several reasons. First, the fixed-effect model assumes that all studies share one common effect size in the population (Borenstein et al., 2009), which can only make conditional inferences to the studies included in a meta-analysis (Field, 2001). Second, we hypothesized that the true effects were heterogeneous and the proposed moderators may explain the heterogeneity. Therefore, employing the random-effect model and assuming that the true effect sizes vary across studies was more appropriate and plausible. There were four conditions in the current meta-analysis: a) synchronous treatment condition vs. asynchronous condition with cognitive outcomes, b) synchronous treatment condition vs. asynchronous condition with affective outcomes, c) synchronous treatment condition vs. face-to-face condition with cognitive outcomes, and d) synchronous treatment condition vs. face-to-face condition with affective outcomes. First, we estimated the overall effect size for each condition. Overall averaged effect size, standard error, confidence intervals, Z and its related p-value, and heterogeneity statistics (Q and its p-value, ""(, and #() were computed. Overall average effect size provides an estimate of the effects of SOL on educational outcomes. Its standard error and confidence intervals provide evidence of the estimation accuracy. The Z and its p-value show whether the effect size estimate is statistically significant. Heterogeneity statistics provide evidence of the variation of the true effect sizes across studies. We also conducted moderator analyses on the four conditions to determine if the heterogeneity (if any) in effect sizes could be accounted for by pedagogical, methodological, demographical, and publication variables. All the moderators are categorical variables, and analyses were conducted with the mixed effects analysis (MEA) as implemented in the CMA 3.0. Finally, it was important to address the issue of publication bias which is when the published research is not representative of the population of work in the domain. In this meta-analysis, both journal articles and dissertations were included, which means some grey literature was accounted for, but there was still the risk of publication bias. Several strategies were used to determine publication bias. Funnel plots showing the relationship between standard errors or studies included and effect sizes (Borenstein, 2009) illustrate A Meta-Analysis on the Effects of Synchronous Online Learning on Cognitive and Affective Educational Outcomes Martin, Sun, Turk, and Ritzhaupt  
216  the spread of the studies. In addition, classic fail-safe N (Rosenthal, 1979), to represent the number of missing studies to bring the p-value to a non-significant level, was included. Finally, we used Orwin’s fail-safe N (Orwin, 1983), which assists in computing the number of missing studies needed to bring the summary effect to a level below the specified value other than zero.  Results Publication Patterns Table 3 shows the publication details of the 19 journal articles and dissertations included in this study. The studies were published in a wide array of journals in several different disciplines, and dissertations were completed at institutions of higher education across the United States. Among the studies, three were published in each of 2008, 2010, and 2014, while there were two in each of 2012, 2015, 2016, and 2018, and one study in 2004 and 2006.

The final sample consisted of k = 27 independent effect sizes (across the four models) and N = 4,409 participants. A total of n = 1,114 students received SOL and the number of students who received asynchronous online learning and face-to-face learning were n = 1,079 and n = 2,216, respectively. Approximately half the studies were conducted with undergraduate students (n = 10, 52.6%), and the rest were conducted with graduates or professionals (n = 9, 47.4%). With respect to disciplines, the most frequently studied was education (n = 5, 26.3%), followed by business (n = 4, 21.1%) and medicine or nursing (n = 3, 15.8%). A majority of the studies were conducted in the United States (78.9%), and four others were conducted in Australia (i.e., Dyment & Downing, 2018), Canada (i.e., Cleveland-Innes & Ally, 2004), Japan (i.e., Shintani & Aubrey, 2016), and China (Taiwan) (i.e., Chen & Shaw, 2006).

218  Overall Effect Sizes Meta-analyses assume normal distribution of observed effect sizes for accurate estimation (Borenstein et al., 2009). The distribution of Hedges’s g is plotted in Figure 3, which suggests that effect sizes were approximately normally distributed. Given the within-study dependent effect sizes, we conducted meta-analyses of the four conditions separately (i.e., synchronous vs. asynchronous with cognitive outcomes, synchronous vs. asynchronous with affective outcomes, synchronous vs. face-to-face with cognitive outcomes, synchronous vs. face-to-face with affective outcomes). The overall effect size statistics for each of the four conditions is presented in Table 5. The effect size was statistically significant in only one model (synchronous vs. asynchronous with cognitive outcomes), and it did not overlap zero in the confidence interval.

Publication bias may threaten the precision of effect estimations of meta-analyses because negative and non-significant results could be under-represented in the sample (Cumming, 2014). 
Various studies have shown that published research is often characterized by 
publication bias, which is why excluding the “grey literature” (unpublished studies and studies published outside widely available journals) generally leads to overestimation of effect sizes (Levine, Asada, & Carpenter, 2009; 
https://doi.org/10.1017/langcog.2019.5  Published online by Cambridge University Pressbrugman et al.48Polanin, Tanner-Smith, & Hennessy, 2016). To avoid overestimation of effect 
sizes, meta-analysis experts strongly recommend including studies from a wide range of academic outlets: journal articles, books, but also doctoral dissertations and conference papers (Borenstein, Hedges, Higgins, & Rothstein, 2011;

Recommendation  2: Searching  non-academic  websites  and database  archives  can be considered  if it is justified  by the content area under  review.  Authors  
could search or browse dedicated grey literature repositories such as OSF Preprints (osf.io/preprints) and Open Grey (opengrey.eu). These efforts will ideally  
improve comprehensiveness of the review as the published literature tends to prioritize positive results whereas grey literature could expose null or negative  
findings.

Rickwood and Bradford (2012) conducted a review of self-help only of mild anxiety disorders, the review was not limited to Randomised Controlled Trials (RCTs) and only contained 6 studies. Self-help programmes may also be effective in the treatment of childhood behaviour disorders (Baumel & Faber, in press; Montgomery, Bjornstad & Dennis, 2006; O’Brien & Daley, 2011). Again, these reviews have been specific and/or not restricted to self-help and guided self-help, for example Baumel and Faber (in press) reviewed the impact of technology-assisted parenting programmes for young people with disruptive behaviours.  The specificity of these previous reviews therefore reduces power to investigate potential moderating variables such as the type of self-help (paper versus online) or impact of guidance. Considering the type of self-help (such as computerised or bibliotherapy), has important implications for service development and delivery (e.g. computerised interventions may require provision of computers for those who do not have access at home and may be more expensive to produce in the short term), yet reviews to date have not investigated this as a moderating variable. Furthermore, while it has been assumed that young people prefer modern technology (e.g. Baumel & Faber, in press), it is not yet established whether this is in fact the case.  The specificity of previous reviews additionally reduces the ability to meta-analyse studies comparing self-help against standard face-to-face treatments as very few such studies exist for each mental health disorder in children. Such analysis is important given that the CYP-IAPT model is based on a stepped-care approach and that UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidance recommends guided self-help as a first step for intervention in some child mental health disorders (NICE, 2005). Face-to-face treatments differ in their efficacy, for example interventions for anxiety have demonstrated greater effect sizes than interventions for depression (e.g. Spek et al., 2007). Therefore, it may be that self-help is similar in efficacy to some face-to-face interventions but has small effect sizes when compared to no treatment (and therefore may not be a preferred option for commissioners) and conversely, there may be self-help treatments that do not compare favourably to face-to-face treatments but nevertheless are efficacious in comparison to no treatment and therefore suitable to be used in a stepped-care approach. Knowledge of patient characteristics that affect efficacy, including whether they meet diagnostic criteria, would then support decisions regarding which patients are entered into which ‘step’ in such a care pathway.  Self-help in children and adolescents: A meta-analysis   
5		Adult reviews have increased power through combining studies of interventions for anxiety and depression (e.g. Cuijpers, Donker, Van Straten, Li & Andersson, 2010) due to high rates of comorbidity between the conditions (Andrews, Slade & Issakidis, 2002) as well as the presence of transdiagnostic interventions designed to treat both anxiety and depression (e.g. Andrews, Cuijpers, Craske, McEvoy & Titov, 2010). Similarly, children and young people tend to have multiple comorbidities, with 40% having more than one diagnosis (Merikangas et al., 2010) and high rates of comorbidity amongst the most common childhood mental health disorders (anxiety, depression and disruptive behaviour disorders). There are child interventions designed to treat comorbid mood and conduct problems (e.g. the Modular Approach to Therapy for Children with Anxiety, Depression, Trauma, or Conduct Problems - MATCH-ADTC; Chorpita & Weisz, 2009) and some child studies have investigated the impact on behaviour interventions on mood and vice versa (e.g. Baker, Sanders, Turner & Morawska, 2017). However, no child reviews to date have combined interventions for anxiety, depression and disruptive behaviour disorders.  This review therefore combines interventions for anxiety, depression and disruptive behaviour in order to investigate possible moderating variables.  An understanding of important moderating variables and user satisfaction of interventions may support the development of guidance regarding self-help programmes for children and young people. In particular, it could support services to decide which of the very many self-help interventions to recommend as they roll out self-help as part of stepped-care.    Objectives The main aim of this review is to systematically assess the evidence-base for the use of unguided self-help and guided self-help for children and young people with symptoms of common mental health disorders (symptoms of anxiety, depression and/or disruptive behaviour). Within this, the objectives are to: 1) Evaluate the efficacy of unguided self-help and guided self-help interventions for symptoms of common mental health disorders in children and adolescents.  2) Compare the effectiveness of unguided self-help and guided self-help interventions to standard face-to face interventions for common mental health disorders in children. 3) Evaluate whether the presence and/or type of guidance given is associated with outcome. Self-help in children and adolescents: A meta-analysis   
6		4) Determine whether type and severity of mental health disorder is associated with outcome. 5) Assess treatment acceptability of unguided and guided self-help for children and young people.  Methods Identification and selection of studies  Search methods Two reviewers independently conducted searches and assessed them for inclusion. Disagreements were resolved through discussion with a third reviewer.  Databases EMBASE, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, CINAHL and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials databases were searched from inception to 11th February 2018. In addition, grey literature searches were conducted through searching the PsycExtra and WorldCat Theses and Dissertations databases. We also searched for trial registrations through clinicaltrials.gov and WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform. Citation searches and searches of reference lists of identified papers were also completed. Reference lists of previous reviews were also examined. Additional literature was sought through personal contact with researchers in the area. No restrictions were placed on publication date or language.  Inclusion Criteria Study type To minimise bias, only RCTs were included in the search.  Participants Children up to the age of 18 years, with no lower age limit. Studies with mixed samples including young adults to 25 years old were included, provided the mean age of the sample was under 18 years old.  It was acceptable for the intervention to be undertaken primarily with parents, provided that child outcomes were reported. Children must have had impairing psychiatric symptoms, of depression, anxiety and/or disruptive behaviour, assessed through a measure of symptoms such Self-help in children and adolescents: A meta-analysis   
7		as the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (Goodman, 1997), a diagnostic instrument, such as the Anxiety Disorders Interview Schedule – Child/Parent (Silverman & Albano, 1996) or self/parent reported difficulties.  Interventions Self-help interventions, including bibliotherapy and computerised therapy were included. Guided self-help interventions were included in the review, provided that the main aim of the intervention was ‘self-help’ and that the guidance was restricted to supporting children and/or parents through the programme rather than teaching new materials. Studies that evaluated interventions in which the guided self-help was a part of the intervention (blended treatments with face-to-face psychotherapy and some guided self-help elements) were excluded.  Comparators Trials with any control group (waiting list, treatment as usual, placebo/attention control or other) were included, as well as with another psychological treatment. Studies which reported insufficient data for the effect size to be calculated were excluded.  Outcome Measures Outcome measures were any measure related to mental health, such as standardised measures for depression, anxiety, or disruptive behaviour, or diagnostic interviews. The measure had to relate to the mental health of the child and not the parent/carer, although parent-reports of child health/behaviour were acceptable. Qualitative results from measures of treatment acceptability were also extracted where available.   Search terms Search terms including MeSH terms were divided into three main areas: self-help, intervention, and mental health disorder, and the areas combined with the AND operator. See Appendix A for full list of search terms. Searches were developed and conducted in collaboration with a librarian (GM).   Data extraction and management Data extraction was completed independently by two raters for each paper and disagreements were resolved by discussion with a third reviewer. Data were extracted on a range of Self-help in children and adolescents: A meta-analysis   
8		variables: participant characteristics, intervention characteristics and study design characteristics, using a pre-designed data extraction form. Study design Data were extracted regarding the comparator (face-to-face, attention, waiting list, treatment as usual, medication) and the target condition (anxiety, depression, disruptive behaviour, or mixed). Length of follow-up (where present) was also determined. We also categorised studies reporting Intention to Treat (ITT) versus those which did not (yes/no).  Participant characteristics Studies were categorised into child (all participants 13 years old or younger), adolescent (participants all older than 13 years old) or mixed studies. Data on mean age and percentage of males were also extracted, in addition to whether participants met diagnostic criteria for the primary mental health disorder using a validated diagnostic measure (yes/no).  Intervention characteristics We extracted data regarding: whether the intervention was unguided or guided self-help (guidance yes/no) and how the self-help was delivered (written materials/computer/mixed/other).  Assessment of risk of bias in included studies Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool (Higgins et al., 2011). 10% of studies were rated by a second independent rater. Disagreements were resolved through discussion with a third independent reviewer. This tool assesses selection bias (including random sequence generation and allocation concealment), blinding of participants and personnel, blinding of outcome assessment (considered at the individual outcome measure level), attrition bias/incomplete outcome data and selective reporting. Regarding blinding of outcome measures, self-report measures were considered at low risk of bias for the purposes of this review. Regarding selective reporting, studies were considered to be at low risk only if there was a study registration or published protocol and the outcomes in the paper matched those pre-specified. We examined the relationship between risk of bias and the effect size by performing meta-regression techniques. In these analyses, the total bias score was entered as the dependent variable. We compared the effect sizes of studies rated as low-risk of bias (all domains evaluated as being at low risk of bias) compared to studies with some risk of bias (one or more domains evaluated as being at unclear or high risk of bias).  Self-help in children and adolescents: A meta-analysis   
9		 Meta-analysis Measurement of treatment effect Separate analyses were conducted for studies using control groups and those comparing against face-to-face interventions. Many studies failed to specify a primary outcome measure and therefore multiple measures were used for several studies. This is particularly the case for behaviour interventions. Only measures that directly related to child outcomes were included, however; measures of parenting practices or parenting self-efficacy were not assessed.  In cases in which multiple measures were reported, no one measure was prioritised. Instead, we combined the results of all measures.  We calculated Hedges’ g for each study outcome, which is the standardised mean difference adjusting for small sample sizes. We used the endpoint score only. Where two or more measures were used per outcome (e.g. depression), the pooled effect sizes were calculated in order to include only one effect size per study in the analysis. Only measures relating to the primary outcome of the disorder were used to generate mean effect sizes (e.g. only measures of depressive symptomatology for a study of a depression intervention). To calculate pooled mean effect sizes, we used Comprehensive Meta-Analysis (CMA) software Version 3 (Biostat, Inc.). A random-effects pooling model was used in all analyses. We transformed standardised mean differences into the Number Needed to Treat (NNT; the number of patients that must be treated to generate one additional positive outcome) using the Kraemer and Kupfer (2006) formula.  We conducted a series of subgroup analyses, according to the mixed effects model. In this model, studies within subgroups are pooled with the random-effects model, whilst tests for significant differences between subgroups are conducted with the fixed-effects model (Borenstein, Hedges, Higgins & Rothstein, 2009). For continuous variables, we used random effects method of moments meta-regression analyses to test whether a significant relationship existed between the continuous variable and the effect size, as indicated by a Z value and associated p-values.  We aimed to analyse the following subgroups: • Different diagnoses (anxiety, depression and disruptive behaviour). • Different types of self-help (bibliotherapy versus computerised). • Different amounts of guidance (i.e. self-help versus guided self-help).

Peer-reviewed literature and grey literature from January 2000 to March 2020 were searched in the following nine databases: Web of Science, PubMed, Cochrane Library, Scopus, EMBASE, CINAHL, ERIC, PsycINFO, and ProQuest Dissertations and Theses. The pri -
mary search terms included intervention characteristics (eg distance education, synchronous, real-time interaction, simultaneous com -
munication, virtual classroom, videoconference, web-conference) and participants’ characteristics (eg medic*, nurs*, dent*, pharmac*, health*, students). The asterisk (*) was used as a truncation sym -
bol during the search. The designed search strategy that followed the PICOS framework is presented in detail in the Appendix S2. The search was supplemented by scanning the reference lists of relevant systematic reviews and meta-analyses.

1855,2020.0_The foreign language classroom anxiety scale and academic achievement: An overview of the prevailing literature and a meta-analysis.pdf,YES,YES,"  35 A comprehensive literature search was conducted in September 2018, using four online databases: PsychINFO, PsychARTICLES, ERIC and Google Scholar. An additional hand-search of three relevant peer-reviewed journals1 was carried out in January 2019. Articles published in English in peer-reviewed journals, conference proceedings, and dissertations submitted for doctoral degrees were examined. A two by four search grid was used in this study, with two keywords aimed at finding Foreign Language Classroom Anxiety (FLCA) measures (“Foreign Language Classroom Anxiety” OR “Language Anxiety”) and four keywords aimed at finding a measure of the language learner’s academic achievement in the language being learned (“Achievement” OR “Performance ” OR ”Grades” OR “Scores”). The search and review strategy of all literature followed the PRISMA guidelines to ensure transparent and consistent reporting of search methods and results (see Moher, Liberati, Tetzlaff, Altman, & the PRISMA Group, 2009).          Figure 1. Selection Process for the Meta-analysis. The database search and journal hand-search resulted in 4364 total results. The search functions in Google Scholar was utilised to exclude non-English results, citations, and duplicates. This resulted in 925 studies in Google Scholar being examined based on title and abstract. Along with the 925 studies, an additional 241 results were generated by PsychINFO,  1 The Modern Language Journal, TESOL Quarterly, Language Learning. 
Journal for the Psychology of Language Learning, Volume 2, June 2020, pp. 26-56. ISSN: 2642-7001. http://www.iapll.com/journal  
  36 PsychARTICLES, ERIC, and the hand-search of journals. Thus, 1166 studies were examined on title and abstract, 1008 of which were excluded for being outside of the scope of the research question of this meta-analysis, for example merely referencing FLCA in a literature review on affective variables in applied linguistics. A total of 158 studies were examined in full-text as a result of the search, of which 66 were included in the meta-analysis. An additional call for unpublished research was made to limit the effect of the ‘file-drawer problem’, which refers to the bias in publication regarding non-significant results (Rosenberg, 2005). Unpublished data also increases the amount of grey literature in the dataset. Grey literature is an umbrella term for conference proceedings, unpublished dissertations, and unpublished data, and as such grey literature usually is not subjected to peer review. The inclusion of grey literature has been found to negate the effects of publication bias in meta-analyses (Conn, Valentine, Cooper, H, & Rantz, 2003). The call for unpublished research resulted in one study being added to the meta-analysis to form a total of 67. The selection process used for the meta-analysis is summarised in Figure 1. It should be noted that of the 67 studies included in the meta-analysis, 14 studies (15%) can be considered ‘grey literature’.  Review Strategy Of the 67 studies generated by the literature search, a total of 99 effect sizes were included in the meta-analysis. The following inclusion criteria were applied: 1. Quantitative Data Requirements: Only quantitative studies were included in the meta-analysis. In addition, only studies that reported correlation coefficients between FLCA and academic achievement were included. In cases in which this information was not available, an attempt was made to reach out to authors if contact details were readily available. One response was garnered and added to the analysis.  2. Measurement of FLCA: Only studies utilising the FLCAS developed by Horwitz et al. (1986) were included. Translated or shortened versions of the FLCAS were also included, with specific deviations from the original 33-item questionnaire noted. Twenty-eight studies included used the original questionnaire, with 33 translated versions and 6 shortened versions utilised. 3. Measurement of academic achievement: General academic achievement was recorded either through grade point average scores or test/exam scores of the foreign language Journal for the Psychology of Language Learning, Volume 2, June 2020, pp. 26-56. ISSN: 2642-7001. http://www.iapll.com/journal  
  37 being learned. In addition, separate data entries for specific achievement measures on reading-, writing-, listening-, and speaking competency in the language being learned were made if available. These competencies were measured through tests, assignments and/or course grades. A summary of the academic achievement measures can be found in Figure 2.  4. Study Designs: No specific designs were excluded from the study. However certain guidelines were followed in regards to coding experiments and group-difference studies. In the experimental studies included in the meta-analysis, only pre-intervention data were recorded. In group-differences studies, the group total data was recorded if available, if not, separate groups were entered into the dataset and this was specifically noted. 5. Moderators: No exclusion criteria were used in terms of moderators.  Coding Strategy The study recorded numerous publication, demographic and descriptive characteristics, as well as data relating to the effect sizes and possible moderator variables (Zessin et al., 2015). With regard to publication characteristics, the authors, year of publication, full title, and publication medium were recorded. The demographic characteristics recorded included sample size, gender distribution, average age, and country where the sample was gathered. Specific descriptive characteristics regarding language learning were also recorded, namely, language being learned, first language of sample, and whether the language course was undertaken through a school, university or private language institute. The measurement characteristics coded included extensive information on the specific version of the FLCAS that was used – whether the original or shortened version was utilised and if the measure was translated. Means, standard deviations, and internal reliability as measured by Cronbach’s alpha (α) of the FLCAS were recorded for each study. Lastly, all possible measures of academic achievement were coded and recorded as outlined in Figure 2. Means, standard deviations and Pearson’s correlations coefficient (r) for each measure of achievement were recorded.

  38  Figure 2. Effect Sizes of Academic Achievement. Though an attempt was made to include and code several moderators in this meta-analysis, only three moderators were sufficiently represented in the included 67 studies to warrant further analyses. Firstly, the proportion of female participants in each study was calculated when a gender ratio of the sample was provided. Secondly, the average age of participants in each study was noted. If no average age was given, but the sample age range spanned two or three years (e.g. 16 – 17 years, see Satar & Özdener, 2008), a mid-point in the age range was used. However, studies where the age ranges exceeded three years and no average age was provided were not included in the moderator analyses. Lastly, the institution type where the language learning took place was noted. The institution types where coded as School Language Course (n = 19), University Language Course (n = 43), or Private Language School Course (n = 5), and treated as a categorical variable. Due to the low number of private language school data entries, the category was not included in the final moderator analyses, and as such only School Language Course and University Language Course will be analysed as a possible categorical moderator.   An agreement rate (AR) was calculated in order to ensure the reliability of the coding process, with the proportion of exact matching codes and values calculated between two coders. Twenty of the 64 studies were coded by two coders, with the proportion of the number of observations agreed upon at an acceptable level of AR = 90% (Bayerl & Paul, 2011).

CI and schizotypy symptom dimensions, and the impact of patient and task variables. Some task variables were assessed to examine CI theory (e.g., cue- probe delay should differentially impact
