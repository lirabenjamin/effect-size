This document is intended to be a working document on a research project about the true distribution of effect size in psychology and it's determinants.

There are three possibilities:
1. There is a potential empirical contribution, a meta-meta analysis. We would analyze published meta-analyses and examine the distribution of effect sizes and their determinants.
2. There is a potential contribution of a review/essay/perspective paper. We would synthesize the literature on effect size in psychology and discuss the implications of the findings.
3. We will conclude that there is no value in pursuing this project.

For now, we will focus on the **empirical** option, which is our working hypothesis.

# Research questions
- What is the distribution of effect sizes in psychology?
- How does this distrbution change for different types of studies?
  - Published vs. unpublished
  - Lab studies vs. field studies
  - Experimental vs. correlational studies
  - Social vs. cognitive
  - Within person vs. between person
  - Concurrent vs. time-lagged
  - Common method vs multi-method
  
# Approach
- We will use meta-analyses as our unit of analysis. We will use the meta-analytic effect size as our dependent variable.
- We could download all meta-analyses published in Psychological Bulletin and code them for the above variables.
- We expect to have a missing data problem with 

# Open questions
- Would it be useful to also use metaBUS
