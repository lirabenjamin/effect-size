Is the subjective well-being (SWB) of high-achieving students generally higher compared to low achiev-
ing students? In this meta-analysis, we investigated the association between SWB and academic achieve-ment by synthesizing 151 effect sizes from 47 studies with a total of 38,946 participants. The correlation
between academic achievement and SWB was small to medium in magnitude and statistically signiﬁcant
atr= 0.164, 95% CI [0.113, 0.216]. The correlation was stable across various levels of demographic vari-
ables, different domains of SWB, and was stable across alternative measures of academic achievement or
SWB. Overall, the results suggest that low-achieving students do not necessarily report low well-being,
and that high-achieving students do not automatically experience high levels of well-being.

1. Introduction
Subjective well-being (SWB) and academic achievement are both
central indicators of positive psychological functioning ( Suldo, Riley,
& Shaffner, 2006 ) and both are variables of interest in identifying the
characteristics of high-performing education systems ( OECD, 2017 ).
According to the OECD (2017) , successful students not only perform
well academically but are also satisﬁed at school. Schools as well as
higher educational environments are not just places where young
people acquire academic skills, they are also places where people
connect with others, develop their personality, experience all facets
of society, all of which might inﬂuence their SWB.
SWB relates to how people feel and think about their lives
(Diener, 1984 ). Individuals reporting high SWB are at lower risk
for a variety of psychological and social problems such as depres-
sion and maladaptive relationships with others (e.g., Furr &
Funder, 1998; Lewinsohn, Redner, & Seeley, 1991; Park, 2004 ).
Among youth, SWB is positively correlated with physical health
and healthy behaviors such as sensible eating and exercise
(Frisch, 2000 ) and negatively related to drug use including alcohol,
marijuana and smoking ( Zullig, Valois, Huebner, Oeltmann, &
Drane, 2001 ). For the educational context, SWB is important as
higher SWB is associated with lower teacher ratings of school-discipline problems ( McKnight, Huebner, & Suldo, 2002 ), an inter-
nal locus of control, high self-esteem and intrinsic motivation
(Huebner, 1991 ). Additionally, people with a higher educational
level are more likely to report higher levels of SWB ( Diener, Suh,
& Oishi, 1997; Nikolaev, 2016 ).
Traditionally, SWB and academic a chievement have been investi-
gated in different strands of the literature. Only recently, in investi-
gating academic achievement, adolescents’ SWB is an increasingly
explored variable (e.g., Adelman & Taylor, 2006; OECD, 2017;
Steinmayr, Crede, McElvany, & Wirthwein, 2015 ) .T h e r ea r eaf e w
cross-sectional studies that su ggest an association between SWB
and academic achievement (e.g., Crede, Wirthwein, McElvany, &
Steinmayr, 2015; Kirkcaldy, Furnham, & Siefen, 2004; Suldo,
Shaffer, & Riley, 2008 ). Some results indicate that higher academic
functioning leads to higher SWB and lower levels of psychopathology
(Suldo & Shaffer, 2008 ) and that students’ great point average (GPA)
positively predicts changes in life satisfaction ( Steinmayr et al.,
2015 ). However, in other cases, SWB and academic achievement
were not statistically sign iﬁcantly correlated (e.g., Huebner, 1991;
Huebner & Alderman, 1993 ). In sum, single studies provide mixed
evidence on the relationship between SWB and academic achieve-ment. To obtain a more precise estimate of this relationship, we con-
ducted a comprehensive meta-analysis of studies providing data on
the correlation between SWB and academic achievement.
Although our study is the ﬁrst to meta-analytically examine the
relationship between SWB and academic achievement, a number
of meta-analyses exist that investigated related constructs. A
recent meta-analysis by Huang (2015) revealed a weak negative

correlation between academic achievement and subsequent
depression. However, Huang (2015) focused on studies investigat-
ing depression as clinically relevant outcome measure, which is
distinct from SWB. Moreover, most studies included by Huang
(2015) used clinical samples and therefore cannot be generalized
to the broader non-clinical population. Ford, Cerasoli, Higgins,
and Decesare (2011) conducted a meta-analysis on the association
between psychological well-being (deﬁned here as a broad con-
struct including fatigue, depression, anxiety or distress, life satis-
faction, subjective well-being, and symptoms of psychological
disorders) and job performance and found an average correlation
ofr= 0.37. Similarly, another large meta-analysis showed that life
success causes SWB and SWB in turn causes life success in several
life domains such as work, social relationships, prosocial behavior,
creativity, and problem solving ( Lyubomirsky, King, & Diener,
2005 ). However, these meta-analyses focused on adults and did
not include measures of academic achievement, which is typically
studied among children, adolescents, and young adults. Academic
achievement was also not included in other meta-analyses on
the correlates of SWB (e.g., Bowling, Eschleman, & Wang, 2010;
Harter, Schmidt, Asplund, Killham, & Agrawal, 2010; Oishi, 2012;
Pinquart & Sörensen, 2000 ).
To gain more insight in the relationship between SWB and aca-
demic achievement and in order to integrate the available empiri-
cal evidence, we conducted a meta-analysis on the association
between SWB and academic achievement. We aimed at estimating
the overall effect size, its statistical signiﬁcance, and moderator
variables of the relation. The remainder of the introduction is
divided in three sections. First, we present conceptual deﬁnitions
of SWB and academic achievement. Second, we state theoretical
arguments suggesting an overall positive relation between these
two constructs. Third, we discuss potential moderators that might
inﬂuence the association between SWB and academic
achievement.
1.1. Subjective Well-Being (SWB)
SWB refers to how people evaluate their lives and is deﬁned as
an individual’s overall state of subjective wellness ( Diener, 1984 ).
It is a broad concept commonly divided into two components
(Busseri & Sadava, 2011; Diener, 1984; Eid & Larsen, 2008 ): Affec-
tive well-being (AWB) reﬂects the presence of pleasant affect (e.g.,
feelings of happiness) and the absence of unpleasant affect (e.g.,
depressed mood). Cognitive well-being (CWB) refers to the cogni-
tive overall evaluation of life satisfaction (i.e., global life satisfac-
tion) as well as of speciﬁc life domains (e.g., job satisfaction or
marital satisfaction) ( Diener, Inglehart, & Tay, 2013 ). Domain-
speciﬁc levels of SWB can be aggregated to obtain an overallSWB score (e.g., Kahneman, Krueger, Schkade, Schwarz, & Stone,
2004 ) and allow the assessment of possible bottom-up inﬂuences
of speciﬁc domains on overall SWB (e.g., does a bad experience
in a particular life domain affect the overall sense of well-
being?). It has been suggested that three facets of SWB – life satis-
faction (LS), positive affect (PA), and negative affect (NA) – should
be measured separately ( Andrews & Withey, 1976; Lucas, Diener, &
Suh, 1996 ), because, for example, the presence of PA does not nec-
essarily comprise the absence of NA. In the current study, we dis-
tinguished between overall and domain-speciﬁc well-being and
between affective and cognitive well-being.
1.2. Academic achievement
Academic achievement is one performance outcome of instruc-
tion and is an important factor for shaping a person’s outlook on
life ( Steinmayr et al., 2015 ). It is associated with lower stress
(Zajacova, Lynch, & Espenshade, 2005 ), higher self-concept ( Guay,Marsh, & Boivin, 2003 ), higher self-efﬁcacy ( Zajacova et al.,
2005 ), and positive health behavior and health ( Eide, Showalter,
& Goldhaber, 2010; Sigfúsdóttir, Kristjánsson, & Allegrante,
2007 ). Academic achievement is essential for mastering several
central developmental goals across the life span, especially during
the school years and young adulthood ( Heckhausen, Wrosch, &
Schulz, 2010
). Engagement with educational goals is related to
more positive developmental outcomes in terms of both SWB
and educational attainments ( Heckhausen & Chang, 2009 ). In addi-
tion to its relevance on an individual level, academic achievement
forms a base for the wealth of a nation ( Steinmayr, Meißner,
Weidinger, & Wirthwein, 2014 ) and is closely linked to national
economic growth ( Cheung & Chan, 2008 ).
Academic achievement can be measured with a wide range of
indicators ( Steinmayr et al., 2014 ). To ensure comparability across
studies, we restricted the present meta-analysis to achievement
measures with a criterion-oriented reference standard such as
grades or academic achievement tests, and excluded measures
with an individual reference standard such as performance com-
pared to other students in class.
1.3. Relation between SWB and academic achievement
High subjective well-being and high academic achievement are
both values that are desirable within our western society. How-
ever, no existing meta-analysis investigated if and how these two
often reported indicators of societal prosperity are related to each
other. SWB and academic achievement could be associated
because (a) academic achievement has a causal effect on SWB,
(b) SWB has a causal effect on academic achievement, or (c) both
SWB and academic achievement are inﬂuenced by common third
variables. The ﬁrst mechanism is consistent with self-
determination theory (SDT; Ryan & Deci, 2000 ), which posits that
three innate psychological needs (competence, relatedness and
autonomy) are essential for intrinsic motivation, personality
growth, social development, and personal well-being. Academic
achievement may therefore lead to SWB through fulﬁlling the need
for competence (e.g., Neubauer, Lerche, & Voss, 2017 ). The second
mechanism is consistent with the broaden-and-build theory of
positive emotions ( Fredrickson, 1998, 2001 ) which posits that the
experience of positive emotions broadens one’s awareness and
allows building new skills and resources, which may ultimately
lead to enhanced academic achievement. Indeed, positive emotions
are associated with better self-regulated learning, higher motiva-
tion, and better examination grades ( Mega, Ronconi, & De Beni,
2014 ) and have a positive effect on memory and attention pro-
cesses ( Fiedler & Beier, 2014 ). Moreover, experiencing positive
emotions is associated with adopting goals oriented towardsapproach and mastery rather than goals oriented towards avoid-
ance ( Linnenbrink & Pintrich, 2002 ). Pursuing mastery-oriented
goals is in turn associated with positive outcomes (see Anderman
& Wolters, 2006 , for a review). Mastery-oriented students persist
longer at academic tasks, are more engaged with their work, use
more effective cognitive processing strategies, use less self-
handicapping, and continue to engage with tasks in the future
when possible ( Tuominen-Soini, Salmela-Aro, & Niemivirta,
2008 ). Moreover, some studies indicate that negative emotionality
is negatively related to school achievement ( Gumora & Arsenio,
2002 ). However, this ﬁnding could not be replicated with different
measures of affect and emotionality (e.g., Supplee, Shaw,
Hailstones, & Hartman, 2004 ).
Finally, the two variables may also be correlated because they
are inﬂuenced by a common third variable. In the case of SWB
and academic achievement, potential confounding variables are
intelligence and socioeconomic status. Intelligence and socioeco-
nomic status are not only positively related to academic achieve-84 S. Bücker et al. / Journal of Research in Personality 74 (2018) 83–94ment (e.g., Deary, Strand, Smith, & Fernandes, 2007; Leeson,
Ciarrochi, & Heaven, 2008; Sirin, 2005 ), but also to SWB. Meta-
analytic results show a small positive relation between general
mental ability and life satisfaction ( Gonzalez-Mulé, Carter, &
Mount, 2017 ) and a small to medium positive relation between
socioeconomic status and life satisfaction ( Pinquart & Sörensen,
2000 ). However, empirical studies indicate that SWB and academic
achievement are associated even after controlling for these vari-
ables (e.g., Crede et al., 2015; Ng, Huebner, & Hills, 2015 ). When
investigating the relationship between academic achievement,
intellectual giftedness, and SWB in adults, Pollet and Schnell
(2017) found that being intellectually gifted was associated with
lower well-being compared to high academic achievers (without
intellectual giftedness).
In sum, although different studies make different assumptions
about the causal direction and the underlying mechanisms of the
association between academic achievement and SWB, they agree
that such an association should exist and that it should be positive.
The strength of this association, however, is less clear and may in
fact vary as a function of various moderator variables. In the largest
study on this question to date, Kirkcaldy et al. (2004) examined
data from 30 countries to determine correlates of SWB and aca-
demic achievement in youth at the national level. They found that
countries with high performance in the PISA survey (academic
achievement in terms of scientiﬁc, mathematical and reading liter-
acy) also had the highest average SWB scores and the strongest
association between SWB and reading achievement ( r= 0.63)
within the country. However, a limitation of the study is that eco-
nomic or social indicators such as high income or small family size
were not statistically controlled. Other studies failed to replicate
the strong correlation found by Kirkcaldy and colleagues. For
example, in a study of adolescents in the UK, Cheng and
Furnham (2002) found a smaller but still statistically signiﬁcant
association between school grades and happiness ( r= 0.25), PA ( r
= 0.29), and NA ( r=/C00.29), controlling for age and gender.
One goal of the present meta-analysis is therefore to examine
how and why the strength of the association between academic
achievement and SWB varies across samples and studies. For this
purpose, we examine both demographic and methodological
moderators.
1.4. Potential demographic moderators1.4.1. Age and gender
The strength of the relation between SWB and academic
achievement may vary as a function of age and gender. The relation
between reading achievement and subsequent depression was
found to vary with age (e.g., Topitzes, Godes, Mersky, Ceglarek, &
Reynolds, 2009 ). This might also be true for the relation between
academic achievement and SWB. Furthermore, life satisfaction
decreases during adolescence (e.g., Goldbeck, Schmitz, Besier,
Herschbach, & Henrich, 2007 ). It is likely that academic achieve-
ment becomes more important at the age of 17–18 (typical age
when applying for university) compared to younger age. This
might lead to a dynamic relationship between SWB and academic
achievement with a lower association in children and a stronger
association in adolescents and young adults.
With respect to gender, girls tend to obtain higher grades in
school than boys (e.g., Berger, Alcalay, Torretti, & Milicic, 2011 ).
Despite the better school performance in girls, they also experience
greater internal distress than boys, evaluate themselves more neg-
atively than boys, and are more prone than boys to worry about
their performance at school ( Pomerantz, Altermatt, & Saxon,
2002 ). This suggests the possibility of a gender difference in the
relation between SWB and academic achievement. However, there
also is evidence indicating that gender does not moderate the linkbetween academic achievement and SWB (e.g., Crede et al., 2015;
Huang, 2015 ; for an exception see Herman, Lambert, Reinke, &
Ialongo, 2008 ). In sum, both age and gender may moderate the
association between SWB and academic achievement and were
therefore included as moderators.
1.4.2. Country and cultural differences
People tend to be happier if they have the characteristics that
are valued in their culture ( Diener, Oishi, & Lucas, 2003; Oishi,
Diener, Suh, & Lucas, 1999 ). For instance, self-esteem is a stronger
predictor of life satisfaction in individualistic than in collectivistic
cultures ( Diener & Diener, 1995 ). The values-as-moderator hypoth-
esis ( Oishi et al., 1999 ) suggests that domains that are value-
congruent should be more important for SWB than domains that
are value-incongruent. Indeed, the strength of the relation betweenlife domains and SWB is moderated by country-level values (e.g.,
Oishi et al., 1999 ). Because the value of academic achievement
might differ between different countries and cultures, country
and cultural differences were examined as moderators of the link
between SWB and academic achievement.
1.4.3. Educational level
The relationship between academic achievement measures and
SWB may depend on the educational level of the students. For
instance, Chang, McBride-Chang, Stewart, and Au (2003) found
that academic test scores obtained from ofﬁcial school records
(Chinese, English and mathematics) were statistically signiﬁcantly
correlated with SWB ( r= 0.38) among a sample of 2nd grade stu-
dents in Hong Kong, but not among a sample of 8th grade students.
Although educational level and age are highly correlated, they are
not the same, particularly not on the university level where stu-
dent populations tend to be heterogeneous with respect to age.
For example, some studies using university samples report a mean
age of almost 26 years (e.g., Grunschel, Schwinger, Steinmayr, &
Fries, 2016 ) whereas others report a mean age of 18 years (e.g.,
Schmitt, Oswald, Friede, Imus, & Merritt, 2008 ). Therefore, we
examined not only age, but also education level as a potential mod-
erator of the association between SWB and academic achievement.
1.5. Potential methodological moderators1.5.1. Study characteristics
The studies included in our meta-analyses were conducted dur-
ing the last four decades. To test if the magnitude of relation
between SWB and academic achievement changed over the time,
we examined publication year as potential moderator.
We included studies using a correlational design (measuring
both constructs at the same occasion) or a longitudinal design(measuring either SWB or academic achievement ﬁrst). For longi-
tudinal designs, the time between assessments differed from study
to study. To examine the stability and directionality of the relation
between SWB and academic achievement, we investigated the
measurement order (SWB measured ﬁrst, academic achievement
ﬁrst, or both measured at the same time) as a moderator of longi-
tudinal effects.
1.5.2. Measurement of academic achievement
The majority of studies used objective or self-reported GPA as
measures of achievement. Alternative measures include standard-
ized achievement tests (e.g., TIMSS; Trends in International Math-
ematics and Science Study). The achievement measurement type is a
plausible moderator of the relation between SWB and academic
achievement because despite the strong correlation between self-
reported and actual GPA ( r= 0.97; Cassady, 2001 ), PA is only
related to objective but not to self-reported measures of college
success ( Nickerson, Diener, & Schwarz, 2011 ). In addition, weS. Bücker et al. / Journal of Research in Personality 74 (2018) 83–94 85explored the content of achievement (general, STEM, language,
social science) as a moderator of the association between SWB
and academic achievement.
1.5.3. Measurement of SWB
To examine differential relations between different types of
measures of SWB and academic achievement, we considered three
independent characteristics of SWB measures as moderators: com-
ponent, life domain, and time frame ( Lischetzke & Eid, 2006 ). With
respect to component , we distinguished between measures of affec-
tive well-being and measures of cognitive well-being. With respect
tolife domain , we distinguished between measures referring to life
overall, measures referring to academic well-being, and measuresreferring to other life domains ( Daig, Herschbach, Lehmann, Knoll,
& Decker, 2009; Diener, 1994 ). Academic well-being refers to
‘‘how students subjectively evaluate and emotionally experience
their school lives” ( Tian, Yu, & Huebner, 2017 ; p. 2). We expected
academic well-being to be more strongly related to academic
achievement than measures tapping into other life domains (e.g.,
ﬁnancial satisfaction, overall life satisfaction). Finally, we examined
whether the time frame of the SWB measure (general, momentary,
precise time frame) moderates the relation between academic
achievement and SWB. Note that the studies included in this
meta-analysis did not always report information on all three
dimensions. For some studies, we only received information about
the SWB component (e.g., cognitive) and the time frame (e.g., gen-
eral) but not about the life domains (overall vs. speciﬁc) or even
only information about one of the three dimensions. Effect sizes
for which no information on a particular dimension of SWB was
given were therefore not included in the respective moderator
analysis.
1.6. Overview of the present meta-analysis
In the present meta-analysis, we examined the association
between SWB and academic achievement and explored demo-
graphic and methodological moderators of this association. The
meta-analysis was guided by the following hypotheses:
Hypothesis 1. SWB is positively associated with academic
achievement.
Hypothesis 2. The association between SWB and academic
achievement differs among achievement measurement types.
Hypothesis 3. The association between academic achievement
and academic satisfaction is stronger than the association between
academic achievement and overall life satisfaction or satisfaction
with non-academic domains.
2. Method
2.1. Literature search and study selection
We conducted a literature search in the database PsycINFO in
winter 2016 and in ERIC in winter 2017. The search process is visu-
alized in Fig. 1 . We restricted the search to studies on human and
non-disordered populations that had been published in a peer
reviewed journal in English language. The keyword combination
with the stated restrictions provided, based on the title, 457 stud-
ies in total. Additionally, we performed an explorative search via
cross-references. The exploratory search provided two more arti-
cles. In total, we screened 459 titles and abstracts for eligibility.
Our inclusion criteria were the following:1.Quantitative data. Articles that were purely theoretical or that
reported qualitative data only were excluded.
2.Mainly non-disordered and non-disabled sample. Only stud-
ies assessing a non-disordered and non-disabled population
were included. Studies with samples of, for example, clinically
depressed or learning-disabled people were excluded.
3.Measurement of relevant constructs. Only studies were
included that reported both SWB and academic achievement
measures.
4.Unduplicated data. Only one publication per data set and only
original empirical ﬁndings were included. Priority was given to
publications reporting (a) more time points, (b) larger sample
sizes, and (c) more descriptive statistics. Re-analyses of already
reported ﬁndings or reviews were excluded.
5.Deﬁnition and measurement of SWB. Studies were included
that used Diener’s (1984) deﬁnition of SWB or a comparable
one (see above). Measures of affective well-being were only
included if they captured the full range of positive or negative
affect, rather than a sub-dimension. Therefore, studies only
focusing on speciﬁc emotions (e.g., anxiety or anger) or using
a different SWB deﬁnition were excluded.
6.Deﬁnition and measurement of academic achievement. Only
studies were included that operationalized academic achieve-
ment according to the deﬁnition by Steinmayr et al. (2014 ;
see above). Studies reporting only other non-academic perfor-
mance measures (e.g., job performance measurements) or
reporting measures such as academic engagement were
excluded.
7.Statistical sufﬁciency. Standardized effect sizes had to be
reported or alternatively one of the following statistics was nec-
essary to calculate effect sizes: means and standard deviations
for each time point, the retest correlation of the outcome vari-
able (e.g., correlation between SWB at T1 and SWB at T2) or a
zero-order correlation coefﬁcient, a torFstatistic, or the mean
and standard deviation of the group or pre-post difference vari-
able. If covariates (such as parents’ education) were reported in
an ANCOVA or multiple regression analysis, effect sizes could
only be coded if also a bivariate correlation between SWB and
academic achievement (e.g., without examining the moderating
effect of parents’ education) was reported.
Study eligibility for our meta-analysis was determined in a two-
step procedure. In a ﬁrst step, the titles and abstracts of the 459
articles were screened for study-relevant characteristics only by
two independent coders and inclusion criteria 1–4 were applied.
In that ﬁrst step, we applied the inclusion criteria rather liberally
to minimize the chance of falsely excluding a relevant article based
on title and abstract. A total of 342 publications were excluded dueto failing to meet one or more criteria. Interrater Agreement (IA)
was assessed as the percentage of agreement between the coders.
Agreement for the ﬁrst step was high (93%). In a second step, the
full texts of the remaining 117 articles were screened for inclusion
or exclusion by the same two independent coders and criteria 5–7
were applied. Seventy publications were excluded because they
failed to meet our inclusion criteria, resulting in a total of 47 stud-
ies included in this meta-analysis. The IA for the second step was
again high (95%). Disagreements between the coders in step 1
and step 2 were resolved by discussion and by consulting the orig-
inal publication.
2.2. Coding
Coding of the 47 studies was done independently by the ﬁrst
and the second author. The coded moderators are listed in Table 1 .
Before beginning, the coders received detailed coding instructions
and were trained in using them. The coding results were recorded86 S. Bücker et al. / Journal of Research in Personality 74 (2018) 83–94in a standardized coding sheet. Interrater Agreement for the coding
was 90% on average and ranged from 78% to 100% for the different
moderating variables (see Table 1 ). In the rare case when relevant
information for coding was missing or unclear in an article, we
contacted the authors via email.
2.3. Preparation of effect sizes
As all included studies reported a zero-order Pearson correla-
tion ( r) between SWB and academic achievement, this meta-
analysis used the correlation coefﬁcient itself as the effect sizeand synthesized all Pearson correlations. Prior to meta-analytic
aggregation, all effects were recoded so that positive effect sizes
indicated that higher SWB was associated with higher academic
achievement. We then transformed all correlations using Fisher’s
Zr-transformation to approximate a normal sampling distribution
(Lipsey & Wilson, 2001 ). As correlations can be biased by measure-
ment error, the effect sizes were corrected for measurement unre-
liability using Spearman’s correction for attenuation ( Hunter &
Schmidt, 2004 ) whenever the reliabilities of the measures were
available. In case of missing reliabilities, the reported correlations
were not corrected. As the majority of included studies reported
Fig. 1. Flow chart for the literature search process.S. Bücker et al. / Journal of Research in Personality 74 (2018) 83–94 87several relevant effect sizes and we included all of them, the effect
sizes in our meta-analysis were not statistically independent (cf.
Hedges, Tipton, & Johnson, 2010 ). Classical ﬁxed-effects or
random-effects meta-analysis rely on the assumption that all
included effect sizes are independent. Ignoring the effect size
dependency in our meta-analysis would lead to an underestima-
tion of the effect size variance, of the width of the conﬁdence inter-
vals, and to inﬂated Type I error rates when testing effect sizes
against zero ( Borenstein, Hedges, Higgins, & Rothstein, 2009 ). We
accounted for this problem by using robust variance estimation
(RVE, Hedges et al., 2010; Tanner-Smith & Tipton, 2014; Tanner-
Smith, Tipton, & Polanin, 2016 ). Using RVE for meta-regression
permits the inclusion of statistically depended effect size estimates
without requiring information about the effect size covariance
structure. RVE mathematically adjusts the standard errors of the
effect sizes to account for the dependency in a data set of effect
sizes.2.4. Statistical analyses
Given the presumed heterogeneity, random-effects statistical
models were used for all analyses ( Raudenbush, 2009 ). Mean effect
sizes and meta-regression models using robust variance estimation
were estimated using a weighted least squares approach (cf.
Hedges et al., 2010; Tanner-Smith & Tipton, 2014 ). To estimate
the overall strength of the correlation of SWB and academic
achievement, we estimated a simple RVE meta-regression model:
yij¼b0þujþeij
where yijis the ith correlation effect size in the jth study, b0is the
average population effect of the correlation, ujis the study level
random-effect such that Var( uj)=s2is the between-study variance
component, and eijis the residual for the ith effect size in the jth
study. To estimate the variability in the effect size due to moderator
variables, we estimated a mixed-effects RVE meta-regression model
where each moderator represents a continuous or speciﬁc dummy
coded level of an included moderator variable (for example aca-
demic speciﬁc satisfaction or other domain-speciﬁc satisfaction;
for more details see Tanner-Smith & Tipton, 2014 ). All dummy
coded moderators were tested against a reference category. The ref-
erence categories are indicated as ‘‘REF” in Table 2 . We used the
robumeta package ( Fisher & Tipton, 2014 ) in the R statistical envi-
ronment ( R Core Team., 2014 ) to perform the meta-analysis.
Each meta-analysis is at danger of yielding results that are dis-
torted by a publication bias ( Borenstein, 2005 ). We estimated pub-
lication bias visually and statistically. First, we conducted visual
and statistical analyses using funnel plots and Egger’s regression
test ( Egger, Smith, Schneider, & Minder, 1997 ) available in the
metafor package ( Viechtbauer, 2010 ) to assess for possible publica-
tion bias. We are not aware of methods to assess publication bias
for dependent effect sizes. Therefore, we conducted the analyses
once for all effect sizes (assuming independence) and once for all
studies with the study-average effect size. Second, we performed
PET and PEESE using the metafor package in R. Both approaches
are meta-regression models for the adjustment of publication bias
or other forms of small-study effects ( Stanley & Doucouliagos,
2014 ) using a conditional estimator (referred to as PET-PEESE).
Depending on the statistical signiﬁcance of the intercept in the
PET model, one interprets either the intercept from the PET model
(if the PET intercept p> .05) or from the PEESE model (if the PET
intercept p< .05) (see Stanley & Doucouliagos, 2014 , for a full
description of the logic behind the conditional nature of PET-
PEESE).
We deliberately did not include unpublished studies or data
because including unpublished studies may in fact increase publi-
cation bias, presumably because unpublished research is often not
representative regarding quality ( Ferguson & Brannick, 2012 ; but
seeRothstein & Bushman, 2012 ).
All reported conﬁdence intervals are at the 95% level. The raw
data and R scripts are available via the Open Science Framework:

is a quickly growing ﬁeld of research. The coded effect sizes ranged
from r=/C00.47 to r= 0.68. The sample sizes ranged from 62 to
11,061 with a median of 411.
Sample mean age ranged from 11 to 26 ( M= 18.5, SD= 3.86). Of
the included effect sizes, 3% were from primary school, 42% from
secondary school, and 55% from higher education. The mean
percentage of females in the included samples was 55.4%
(SD= 19.63). In most studies, the predominant ethnicity was
White/Caucasian (30%). However, 66% of the included studies did
not report the ethnicity of their sample. Regarding the country of
education, 40.4% of studies were based on samples educated in
North America, 23.4% in Europe, 12.8% in Australia or New Zealand,
14.9% in Asia, and 2.1% in South America.
About 75% of the effects were obtained using a correlational
study design measuring SWB and academic achievement at onemeasurement point. A longitudinal design was used in about 25%
of the cases either measuring SWB ﬁrst (14%) or measuring aca-
demic achievement ﬁrst (9%). The time intervals for the longitudi-
nal studies varied between 14 days (approximately 2 weeks) and
420 days (approximately 14 months). However, not every longitu-
dinal study reported a time interval (16% of information on time
intervals were missing).
The measures of academic achievement were objective GPA/-
grades (67.6%), self-reported GPA/grades (19.9%), and academic
achievement tests (21.2%). One study used a parent-report of
GPA as measure (0.6%). For SWB, 36.4% of effect sizes were
obtained from measures that focused on the affective component
of SWB (e.g., PANAS; Watson, Clark, & Tellegen, 1988 ), 23.8% from
measures that focused on the cognitive component of SWB (e.g.,
SWLS; Diener, Emmons, Larsen, & Grifﬁn, 1985 ), and 39.7% could
not be assigned deﬁnitely. About 53% of the SWB measures indi-Table 2

sures (29.1% academic speciﬁc measures and 17.2% other
domain-speciﬁc measures). Most measures used a general time
frame (43.7%), 23.8% used a precise time frame (e.g., PA during
the last two months), and 2% assessed momentary SWB
(moment-to-moment variation of SWB). The remaining 30.5% did
not report the time frame of measure.
3.2. Overall effect
The overall mean effect size and the mean effect sizes for the
levels of the moderator variables are presented in Table 2 . The
overall correlation between academic achievement and SWB was
r= 0.164 with a 95% conﬁdence interval ranging from 0.113 to
0.216. The overall effect with uncorrected effect sizes differed only
slightly on the second decimal from the one with corrected effect
sizes according to Hunter and Schmidt (2004) . We therefore used
the corrected effect sizes. The measure of heterogeneity I2=
93.964 ( s2= 0.027) indicates substantial heterogeneity, implying
that the relation between academic achievement and SWB might
be moderated by third variables.
The funnel plots in Fig. 2 do not indicate the presence of a pub-
lication bias, as the plots resemble symmetrical inverted funnels
such that effect sizes from smaller studies scatter widely at the
bottom and effect sizes from larger studies scatter more narrowly
towards the top ( Sterne & Egger, 2001 ). The absence of a publica-
tion bias in our data was also conﬁrmed by a test for funnel plot
asymmetry ( Egger et al., 1997 ) testing the null hypothesis that
symmetry in the funnel plot exists. The Egger test revealed no indi-
cation of publication bias on both study level ( z= 0.562 ,p= .574)
and on effect size level ( z= 0.645, p=.519). Additionally, the true
effect size estimated using PET-PEESE was statistically signiﬁcant
and comparable in strength to our originally reported effect size
(see our online material on OSF). Together, these analyses suggest
that there is little evidence for a ﬁle-drawer problem in the present
meta-analysis.
3.3. Moderator analyses
The results of moderator analyses are shown in Table 2 . The
heterogeneity measure s2ranged between 0.006 and 0.278 forthe different moderators. Regarding our Hypotheses 2 and 3, we
obtained the following results.
3.3.1. Demographic variables as moderators
None of the demographic moderators such as age, age squared,
gender, country of education or level of education had a statisti-
cally signiﬁcant moderating effect, indicating that the relation
between SWB and academic achievement was similar in differentage and gender groups.
3.3.2. Methodological variables as moderators
Moderator analysis revealed that the magnitude of the associa-
tion between SWB and academic achievement was not inﬂuenced
by publication year. The association between the two constructs
was not statistically signiﬁcantly different when measuring both
constructs at the same measurement point or when measuring
SWB or academic achievement ﬁrst. It made no difference how
much time lay between the assessments or whether the study
design was correlational or longitudinal.
None of the three investigated characteristics of measurement
of academic achievement reached signiﬁcance. The correlation
between SWB and academic achievement was neither moderated
by measurement type nor by the reliability of measurement. Thus,
our second hypothesis assuming that the association between SWB
and academic achievement differs for different achievement mea-
surement types could not be conﬁrmed.
It did not make a difference if well-being was measured focus-
ing on the cognitive or the affective component of SWB. Addition-
ally, the correlation between academic speciﬁc well-being
measures and academic achievement was only descriptively
slightly higher ( r= 0.180; CI [0.076, 0.277]) than between overall
SWB ( r= 0.166; CI [0.115, 0.217]) or other domain-speciﬁc well-
being measures ( r= 0.072; CI [ /C00.024, 0.165]) and academic
achievement. However, this difference did not reach statistical sig-niﬁcance, which is not concordant with our third hypothesis.
4. Discussion
The current meta-analysis synthesized the published ﬁndings on
the relation between SWB and academic achievement. Across all
151 effect sizes, the average strength of the association was r=
Fig. 2. Funnel plots of the 47 studies and the 151 effect sizes by standard error.90 S. Bücker et al. / Journal of Research in Personality 74 (2018) 83–940.164, 95% CI [0.113, 0.216]. According to Gignac and Szodorai
(2016) , this effect size can be interpreted as relatively small to med-
ium. This association is slightly lower but still comparable in magni-
tude to the ones reported between SWB and other success outcome
measures. For example, the correlation between SWB and job per-
formance was r= 0.22 ( DeLuga & Mason, 2000 ) and the correlation
between SWB and income r= 0.20 ( Lucas, Clark, Georgellis, &
Diener, 2004 ). The relatively small effect for the relation of SWB
and academic achievement in the present meta-analysis was not
surprising. Huang (2015) conducted a meta-analysis of longitudinal
studies on academic achievement and subsequent depression. He
found a very similar but – because of depression as a negative
dependent variable – negative overall effect of r=/C00.15 In our
meta-analysis, the moderator analyses did not provide any statisti-
cally signiﬁcant effects, which indicates that the correlationbetween SWB and academic achievement is robust across different
levels of the examined moderators. For some moderators, this ﬁnd-
ing was in line with other meta-analyses. For example, demographic
moderators such as age or gender were also not signiﬁcant in
Huang’s (2015) meta-analysis on academic achievement and
depression. However, the absence of a signiﬁcant moderator effect
of the life domain of the SWB measure (academic vs. overall vs. other
life domains) requires further discussion.
One explanation for this ﬁnding might be that because children
and young adults spend a substantial amount of their time at
school, students’ overall life satisfaction and their academic satis-
faction might be highly overlapping and not as distinct as we
expected. Another explanation is that we might not have detected
a signiﬁcant moderator effect due to low statistical power, as only
17.2% of the included effect sizes referred to other domain-speciﬁc
satisfaction measures such as ﬁnancial satisfaction or health
satisfaction.
4.1. Implications
Students’ school experiences are important in inhibiting or
facilitating successful development over the lifespan (e.g., Schaps
& Solomon, 2003; Tian et al., 2017 ). School effectiveness research
has mainly focused on cognitive outcomes, especially on mathe-
matics, language, or science achievement. However, Noddings
(2003) stated that ‘‘happiness and education are, properly, inti-
mately connected. Happiness should be an aim of education, and
a good education should contribute signiﬁcantly to personal and
collective happiness” (p. 1). According to the OECD (2015) , ‘‘aca-
demic achievement that comes at the expense of students’ well-
being is not a full accomplishment” (p. 4). Correspondingly, cogni-
tive outcomes such as academic achievement and non-cognitive
outcomes such as student well-being should be considered as
two different and distinctive aims of education (cf. Opdenakker &
Van Damme, 2000 ).
In our meta-analysis, academic achievement and well-being are
statistically signiﬁcantly but only relatively weakly related. This
suggests that low-achieving students do not necessarily report
low SWB, and high-achieving students do not automatically report
high SWB. Even if enhancing subjective well-being is discussed as
an aim of education, it has been demonstrated that educational
institutions have far more inﬂuence on academic achievement
than on well-being (cf. Opdenakker & Van Damme, 2000 ). Addi-
tionally, not necessarily the individual achievement but the char-
acteristics of classmates such as ability and gender have an
impact on students’ well-being. For example, a literature review
on the effect of class composition on secondary school students’
school well-being and academic self-concept concludes that the
average achievement level of a class has an additional positive
effect on students’ well-being when controlling for initial achieve-
ment of the students ( Belﬁ, Goos, De Fraine, & Van Damme, 2012 ).
This indicates that being in a class with high-ability classmates isbeneﬁcial for students’ school well-being. However, Belﬁ et al.
(2012) also mention that ability-grouped classes have a positive
impact on the school well-being of strong students, while they
have a rather negative impact on the school well-being of weak
students. Hence, not only the individual academic achievement
but also the achievement level in a class seems to be important
for students’ SWB.
4.2. Limitations and future directions
Meta-analyses are always inﬂuenced by the quality of the
included studies. We discuss the most important constraints and
unanswered questions of previous research to provide directions
for future studies on SWB and academic achievement. To test rel-
evant moderators, a sufﬁcient amount of single studies investigat-
ing those variables is necessary. Unfortunately, we were not able toexamine an effect for predominant ethnicity since most studies
had been conducted with predominantly White/Caucasian sam-
ples. The mean age of the samples included in the present meta-
analysis ranged between 11 and 26 years ( M= 18.5), which allows
conclusions for childhood and young adulthood but also implies
that further research on other age groups is necessary.
This study did not examine potentially relevant moderators
such as ability level, intelligence, motives such as need for achieve-
ment, test anxiety, academic engagement, or socioeconomic status
because most primary research did not collect or report data for
these variables. These third variables might not only inﬂuence
the levels of academic achievement and SWB, but also the strength
of their relationship. Thus, future research should address the
question whether the relationship between academic achievement
and SWB still exists when including relevant third variables and
whether the association found in the present meta-analysis is
mediated by other factors. Ng et al. (2015) found that the relation
between academic achievement and life satisfaction stays statisti-
cally signiﬁcant even when controlling for socioeconomic status,
but they did not investigate intelligence. It remains an open task
for subsequent research to include variables like intelligence or
socioeconomic status when investigating academic achievement
and SWB to get a more precise picture of the unique relationship
between these variables.
While the measures of academic achievement are largely homo-
geneous between studies with most of them reporting GPA, there
is a broad number of different measures for SWB. Some studies
assessed SWB with a single item whereas others used measures
with 40 Items (e.g., Multidimensional Students’ Life Satisfaction
Scale; Huebner, 1994 ). Further research is necessary to clarify
which SWB measure is most reliable and valid in different age
groups. Measures are particularly heterogeneous for academic sat-
isfaction. Some studies apply items originally developed to mea-sure overall life satisfaction (e.g., Satisfaction With Life Scale;
Diener et al., 1985 ) to university life (e.g., Ocal, 2016 ). Others use
measures speciﬁcally developed to measure academic satisfaction
(e.g., Academic Satisfaction Scale; Schmitt et al., 2008 ). Most stud-
ies used SWB measures that captured either the affective or the
cognitive component of SWB. Future studies should collect mea-
sures of SWB that capture both components as well as additional
measures of well-being such as parents’ or peer reports.
Only 25% of the effect sizes included in our meta-analyses came
from longitudinal studies. More longitudinal research using
designs with three or more measurement points is needed to
examine (a) how the relationship between the variables changes
over time, (b) whether the strength of the relationship depends
on the time lag between the measurements, and (c) the reciprocal
relationships of these variables over time (cf. Marsh, Byrne, &
Yeung, 1999 ). To reveal deﬁnite causal effects of SWB on academic
achievement or academic achievement on SWB, experimental
designs are needed.S. Bücker et al. / Journal of Research in Personality 74 (2018) 83–94 91Finally, Oishi, Diener, and Lucas (2007) showed that people who
experience levels of happiness slightly below the maximum are the
most successful in terms of income, education, and political partic-
ipation, indicating that the relation between SWB and success may
be non-linear. Applied to academic achievement, this notion
implies that it is worthwhile to investigate a potential non-linear
relation between SWB and academic achievement in future
research.
To conclude, we outline the following three central recommen-
dations for future research on the association between SWB and
academic achievement. Future studies could proﬁt from:
(1) Examining the relationship between SWB and academic
achievement longitudinally using large samples to investi-
gate the reciprocal (causal) relationship between the twoconstructs and its development over the life span.
(2) Including potential inﬂuencing third variables such as intel-
ligence or socioeconomic status.
(3) Considering the possibility that the relation between SWB
and academic achievement might not be non-linear ( Oishi
et al., 2007 ).
5. Conclusion
The present study provides an overview of the current state of
research on the relation between SWB and academic achievement.
We found a relatively small to medium correlation between both
constructs. However, this effect is nevertheless relevant because
the accumulating effects of academic success or failure combined
with other factors can have long-term effects on a person’s well-
being and, in turn, on health and longevity ( Diener & Chan,
2011 ). The relatively small overall effect means that high academic
achievement does not always result in better quality of life for
learners, and even more importantly that being bad at school does
not automatically mean someone cannot be happy.

Objective: We conducted a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to promote health behavior
change based on self-determination theory (SDT). The review aimed to (a) quantify the impact of SDTinterventions on health behaviors, (b) test mediation by theoretically specified variables (autonomous moti-vation and perceived competence), and (c) identify moderators of intervention effectiveness. Method:
Computerized searches and additional strategies identified 56 articles that yielded 65 independent tests of SDTinterventions. Random effects meta-analysis and metaregressions were conducted via STATA; meta-analyticstructural equation modeling (MASEM) was used to test mediation. Results: The sample-weighted average
effect size for SDT interventions was d
/H11001/H11005.23, and there were significant effects for physical activity,
sedentary behavior, diet, alcohol consumption, and smoking cessation (.16 /H11350d/H11001/H11350.29). Effect sizes exhibited
both publication bias and small sample bias but remained significantly different from zero, albeit of smallermagnitude, after correction for bias ( d
/H11001/H11350.15). MASEM indicated that autonomous motivation and perceived
competence mediated intervention effects on behavior. Metaregression analyses indicated that features of thesample, intervention, or methodology generally did not moderate effect sizes. Conclusion: The present review
indicates that SDT interventions have a significant but small effect on health behavior change and suggestsseveral directions for future research.

726Noncommunicable diseases accounted for 73% of all global
deaths in 2017, and more than 50% of all deaths were attributableto just four risk factors related to lifestyle choices: high bloodpressure, smoking, high blood glucose, and high body mass index(The Lancet, 2018 ). The implication is that behavioral interven-
tions that effectively target diet, physical activity, alcohol con-sumption, and smoking have the potential to reduce rates ofmortality and morbidity considerably ( Kaplan, 2019 ). Health be-
havior theories specify a range of constructs that (a) predict healthbehaviors and (b) can be modified by interventions ( Sheeran,
Klein, & Rothman, 2017 ). One prominent theory that has been
used extensively to promote health behavior change is self-determination theory (SDT; Ryan & Deci, 2017 ;Ryan, Patrick,
Deci, & Williams, 2008 ). However, a quantitative synthesis of the
efficacy of SDT interventions in changing health behaviors re-mains to be undertaken. We undertook a meta-analysis of random-ized controlled trials (RCTs) to (a) determine the efficacy of SDTinterventions in promoting health behavior change, (b) test medi-ators of SDT intervention effects, and (c) identify factors thatmoderate intervention effectiveness.
According to SDT, the “psychological states most essential for
making meaningful change in terms of health behavior are: (1)being autonomously motivated for the change, and (2) perceivingoneself to be competent to make the change” ( Ryan & Deci, 2017 ,
p. 455). Autonomous motivation is an overarching term for regu-
latory styles that reflect self-endorsed reasons for behavioral en-gagement, such as enjoyment (intrinsic motivation), alignmentwith one’s core values (integrated regulation), and personal utility(identified regulation). Autonomous motivation is often contrastedin the SDT literature with controlled motivation , the overarching
term that refers to non–self-determined regulatory styles. Thesestyles of behavioral regulation reflect internal pressure or the needto prove something to others (introjected regulation), or externalpressure and contingent rewards (external regulation). Perceivedcompetence is the second antecedent of health behavior change(Ryan & Deci, 2017 ). According to Williams et al. (2006) , per-
ceived competence refers to feeling able to attain health outcomesor perform health behaviors and is similar to the construct ofself-efficacy ( Bandura, 1997 ).
Ng et al. (2012) distinguished two variants of SDT as applied to
health. The first, proposed by Ryan et al. (2008) , traces the impact
of interventions promoting autonomy support through basic psy-chological needs for autonomy, competence, and relatedness tostyles of behavioral regulation (autonomous vs. controlled moti-vation), and ultimately to health behaviors and health outcomes.Health care systems support autonomy by encouraging individualsto engage in health behaviors for their own reasons, fosteringeffective management of barriers to change, and conveying feel-ings of acceptance and respect. Autonomy support, in turn, leads tothe satisfaction of three basic psychological needs—for autonomy(the need to feel in control of one’s behavior), competence (theneed to feel effective in producing desired outcomes), and relat-edness (the need to feel accepted by, and meaningfully related to,others)—which serve to enhance autonomous motivation and per-ceived competence, and so engender behavior change.
The second variant of SDT identified by Ng et al. (2012) is the
more parsimonious model developed by Williams, Gagné, Ryan,
and Deci (2002 ,2006 ) specifically for health care settings. Wil-
liams et al.’s model focuses on the impact of autonomy supportiveinterventions on both autonomous motivation and perceived com-
petence, and how changes in these proximal determinants influ-ence health. This model forms the focus of the present review.
1
Although reviews are largely supportive of SDT predictions,
there are notable gaps in the evidence base. First, it is not yet clearhow effective are SDT interventions in promoting health behaviorchange. Multiple SDT interventions proved effective in changingbehavior (e.g., Chatzisarantis & Hagger, 2009 ;Fortier, Sweet,
O’Sullivan, & Williams, 2007 ;Gourlan, Sarrazin, & Trouilloud,
2013 ;Ha, Lonsdale, Ng, & Lubans, 2017 ), but there are also
multiple reports of ineffective interventions ( Duda et al., 2014 ;
Gillison, Standage, & Skevington, 2013 ;Mayer et al., 2018 ;Men-
doza et al., 2017 ). This offers a clear rationale for a quantitative
synthesis that estimates the magnitude of SDT intervention effects,and for moderator analyses to identify factors that determineeffectiveness. Second, previous reviews of SDT interventions didnot address all relevant outcomes. Gillison, Rouse, Standage,
Sebire, and Ryan (2019) meta-analyzed 84 experimental and
quasi-experimental studies of SDT interventions to promote healthbehaviors. The review observed significant changes in perceivedautonomy support ( g/H11005.84) and autonomous motivation ( g/H11005.41)
but did not report intervention effects on perceived competenceand did not test SDT effects on health behaviors.
Third, evidence that autonomous motivation and perceived com-
petence predict health behaviors relies on correlational data ( Ng et
al., 2012 ;Teixeira, Carraça, Markland, Silva, & Ryan, 2012 ).
However, the fact that a particular variable predicts behavior incorrelational tests does not indicate whether interventions thatincrease scores on that variable will change behavior ( Sheeran,
Harris, & Epton, 2014 ). This is because (a) correlational designs
cannot rule out the influence of third variables (i.e., variables suchas health literacy, conscientiousness, or optimism that could en-gender spurious links between the predictors and behavior) and (b)evidence indicates that findings from correlational tests generallyoverestimate the behavioral impact of intervention studies thatchange the relevant predictor ( Sheeran et al., 2017 ). A synthesis of
experimental or intervention studies is needed to determinewhether SDT interventions change health behaviors and to for-mally assess whether autonomous motivation and perceived com-petence mediate the impact of SDT interventions on behaviorchange.
The foregoing discussion indicates that a new, comprehensive
review of SDT interventions, focused on high-quality evidencefrom RCTs, is needed. Accordingly, the present review aimed to:(a) quantify the impact of SDT interventions on health behaviorchange via meta-analysis; (b) determine whether SDT interven-tions promote health behavior change by increasing autonomous
1Although it would have been desirable to test Ryan et al.’s (2008)
model wherein (a) interventions determine levels of perceived autonomysupport, (b) perceptions of autonomy support, in turn, predict satisfactionof needs for autonomy, competence, and relatedness, (c) needs satisfactionpredicts autonomous motivation and perceived competence, and (d) auton-omous motivation and perceived competence predict health behaviorchange, too few data were available to do so in the present review. Therewere 17, 12, 12, and 11 tests of intervention effects on perceptions ofautonomy support and satisfaction of needs for autonomy, competence, andrelatedness, respectively. However, few studies reported relevant intercor-relations among these variables, which meant that the relationships spec-ified by Ryan et al. (2008) could not be modeled.727 SELF-DETERMINATION THEORY INTERVENTIONSmotivation and perceived competence using meta-analytic struc-
tural equation modeling (MASEM); and (c) identify sample, in-tervention, or methodological features that moderate interventioneffectiveness using metaregression analyses.
Method
The meta-analysis was registered at Prospero (CRD4201809
7040) and followed PRISMA guidelines ( Moher, Liberati, Tet-
zlaff, Altman, & The PRISMA Group, 2009 ). The PRISMA
Checklist is presented in Table S1 in the online supplemental
materials. Study data have been deposited on the Open ScienceFramework ( https://osf.io/k8maf/?view_only /H110054e5e7ff1f078426
cbb94892f76d8190a ).
Search Strategy
Studies were obtained via (a) a computerized search of relevant
databases (PubMed, PsycINFO, Web of Science) initiated onFebruary 19, 2018, (b) a manual search of the reference lists ofprevious reviews and articles that met the inclusion criteria for thereview, and (c) requests for unpublished studies via e-mails to keyresearchers and the listservs of professional societies (Society forPersonality and Social Psychology, Society of Behavioral Medi-cine, European Health Psychology Society, selfdeterminationtheo-ry.org). The computerized search strategy included terms for (a)self-determination theory, (b) RCT (e.g., trial, intervention), and(c) various health behaviors. Search terms were optimized for eachdatabase by a medical librarian (see Table S2 in the online sup-
plemental materials for the precise search terms).
There were four inclusion criteria for the review. First, the study
used a randomized controlled or cluster randomized design; quasi-experimental and observational/correlational studies were ex-cluded. Second, the study included an intervention based on self-determination theory (i.e., the authors stated that the interventionwas based on SDT and/or constructs specified by SDT weretargeted by the intervention). Third, a measure of health behaviorwas taken in the wake of the intervention. Health behaviors weredefined as “overt behavioral patterns, actions, or habits that relateto health maintenance, to health restoration and to health improve-ment” ( Gochman, 1997 , p. 3). Fourth, the report was written in
English.
Figure 1 shows the flow of information through phases of the
present review. The computerized database search identified 640articles and theses, of which 46 were duplicates. Screening of titlesand abstracts resulted in the exclusion of a further 440 recordsbecause they did not concern health behaviors or did not reportfindings from a RCT. Assessment of the eligibility of 154 full-textrecords led to the exclusion of 98 articles. Reasons for exclusionwere (a) duplicate study information was reported (protocol paper,baseline findings, etc.; n/H1100528), (b) study did not involve self-
determination theory ( n/H1100527), (c) study did not report a measure
of behavior ( n/H1100521), (d) study was not a RCT ( n/H1100519), (e)
publication was a conference abstract ( n/H110052), or (f) compared two
different SDT interventions ( n/H110051). Fifty-six papers met our
inclusion criteria. Because some papers reported multiple studiesor trials had multiple intervention groups, a total of 65 effect sizescould be computed from these reports. The online supplementalmaterials present the characteristics of each study included in thereview ( Table S3 andS4), and the references for the 56 papers.Analysis Strategy
We used Cohen’s das the effect size metric. Effect sizes
represent the difference in the behavior of interest at follow-up forthe treatment compared with the control condition; larger positivevalues indicate more effective interventions (i.e., higher rates ofhealthy behaviors and lower rates of unhealthy behaviors). Whenmultiple indicators of behavior were reported in a single study, weused each individual effect size to assess the impact of interven-tions on these different outcomes and also computed the weightedaverage effect size within the study to represent the overall studyeffect. When studies included more than one treatment condition,
we divided the sample size for the control group by the number ofintervention groups, so as not to “double count” participants ( Hig-
gins & Green, 2011 ). To offer a strong test of the effectiveness of
SDT interventions on health behaviors, effect sizes were computedusing (a) data from the longest follow-up after the intervention and(b) intention-to-treat analyses if both intention-to-treat and perprotocol analyses were reported ( Sheeran et al., 2014 ).
We used STATA Version 14.0 ( StataCorp, 2015 ) to conduct
random effects meta-analyses and metaregressions. After correct-ing sample sizes for clustering, we computed the sample-weightedaverage effect size and computed heterogeneity statistics ( Q,I
2).
Next, we checked for publication bias using the funnel plot andEgger’s regression. Duval and Tweedie’s (2000) trim and fill
procedure was used to correct for publication bias. Small samplebias was assessed using the procedure recommended by Coyne,
Thombs, and Hagedoorn (2010) ; we coded whether or not studies
had adequate power (i.e., 55% power to detect a medium-sizedeffect even when it is present) and regressed effect sizes on thispredictor. We also used random effects metaregressions to testassociations between effect sizes and (a) sample characteristics, (b)features of the intervention, and (c) methodological features, in-cluding study quality (risk of bias).
Coded Variables
Sample, intervention, and methodological characteristics.
Sample, intervention, and methodological characteristics thatcould potentially moderate effect sizes were coded from eachstudy (see Table S3 in the online supplemental materials). Sample
characteristics included designations such as clinical (i.e., partici-pants diagnosed with physical ailments), sedentary/inactive, over-weight, adolescents, and older adults as well as mean age, gendercomposition of sample, and mean body mass index (BMI); inter-vention characteristics included the source and setting of theintervention, total contact time, as well as modes of delivery;methodological features included whether the control conditionwas active and aspects of study quality, assessed using the Co-chrane Collaboration’s Tool for Assessing Risk of Bias ( Higgins &
Green, 2011 ).
Reliability of coding. Charles Wright and Megan Villegas
independently coded effect sizes ( k/H1100538, 34% of tests) along with
sample, intervention, and methodological characteristics ( k/H1100520,
36% of tests). Coding proved reliable ( M
ICC/H11005.98,MKAPPA/H11005
0.94; all ICC and Kappa values were greater than 0.70). Discrep-ancies were resolved through discussion.728 SHEERAN ET AL.Results
Trial Characteristics
On average, tests of interventions involved 115 participants in
the treatment condition and 91 participants in the control condition(SD/H11005159 and 144, respectively). Interventions primarily targeted
adults ages 24–49 years ( k/H1100539), adolescents aged 12–18 years
(k/H1100515), and university students ( k/H110058), but there were 13 studies
of sedentary/inactive participants and 12 studies with clinicalsamples. Participants were predominantly white ( M/H1100558.1%) and
female ( M/H1100562.1%) and had a mean age of 35.7 years ( SD/H11005
17.0). Participants had an average BMI of 26.45 ( SD/H110053.10) in the
22 studies that reported BMI.
Almost one half of articles included in the review came from the
United States (27 of 56). Interventions were conducted at schoolsor universities ( k/H1100514), in hospital/clinic settings ( k/H1100513),
community centers ( k/H1100511), and/or at home ( k/H110057), and pre-
dominantly involved group counseling sessions ( k/H1100521), one-to-
one, in-person counseling sessions ( k/H1100521), or counseling via
telephone ( k/H1100515) or online ( k/H1100511). Interventions were mainly
delivered by a researcher ( k/H1100525) or a counselor ( k/H1100512). Most
interventions lasted at least one month and up to six months. Themean number of intervention sessions was 8.25 ( SD/H1100515.94), and
the average contact time was 9.52 hr ( SD/H1100518.73). Follow-up
periods for interventions ranged from immediate to 2 years ( M/H11005
12.60 weeks, SD/H1100525.05). The mean attrition rate was 19.14%.
Most studies were adequately powered according to Coyne et al.’s
(2010) criterion ( k/H1100541). Study quality assessed via the Cochrane
tool generated mixed results (see Table S5 in the online supple-
mental materials). Selective reporting ( k/H110055) and failure to blind
outcome assessors ( k/H11005
14) were infrequent; however, incomplete
outcome data ( k/H1100526), lack of random sequence generation ( k/H11005
33), and lack of allocation concealment ( k/H1100536) were relatively
common.
Impact of SDT Interventions on Health Behaviors
The sample-weighted average effect size for 65 trials was of
small magnitude ( d/H11001/H11005.23, 95% CI [.16, .29]). Table 1 presents
effect sizes by type of behavior. Most interventions targeted phys-ical activity ( k/H1100550), sedentary behavior ( k/H1100510), diet-related
behaviors ( k/H110058), and smoking cessation ( k/H110056), and were
similarly effective in promoting these behaviors (.16 /H11349d
/H11001/H11349.25),
Q/H110053.97, p/H11005.27. SDT Interventions led to significant reductions

monitoring, screen time, or cancer screening. It made no differenceto effect sizes whether physical activity was measured objectivelyvia accelerometer/pedometer data ( d
/H11001/H11005.29) or by self-reports
(d/H11001/H11005.23), Q/H110055.86, p/H11005.12. There was no difference in the
effect size observed for the 26 studies that used an immediatefollow-up in the wake of the intervention compared to the 30studies that used a longer-term follow-up ( d
/H11001/H11005.24 and .22,
respectively), Q/H110050.12, p/H11005.734. It also made little difference to
the sample-weighted average d/H11001if a single effect size was com-
puted for studies that had multiple treatment arms ( d/H11001/H11005.25, 95%
CI [.18, .32], k/H1100556,Q/H11005161.72, p/H11021.001, I2/H1100566.0%).
Figure S1 in the online supplemental materials presents the
forest plot of effect sizes. Effects were heterogeneous ( Q/H11005
148.58, p/H11021.001), and heterogeneity was of moderate magnitude
(I2/H1100556.9). Inspection of the funnel plot (see Figure 2 ) suggested
that the observed effects were characterized by publication biasand Egger’s regression proved significant ( B/H110051.17, SE/H110050.36,p/H11005.002). Trim and fill analysis to correct for publication bias led
to the imputation of k/H1100511 additional effects and yielded an
adjusted d
/H11001/H11005.15 (95% CI [.08, .22]).
Metaregression indicated that the effects were characterized by
small sample bias ( B/H11005/H11002 .30,SE/H110050.10, p/H11005.004). Studies that
were adequately powered according to Coyne et al.’s (2010) cri-
terion yielded a smaller average effect size ( d/H11001/H11005.18, 95% CI
[.12, .24]) compared with underpowered studies ( d/H11001/H11005.50, 95%
CI [.30, .70]). Seven studies included in the review were unpub-lished (13.0%). Metaregression of effect sizes on publication status(published /H110051, unpublished /H110050) indicated that the association
was not significant ( B/H11005/H11002 .11,SE/H110050.14, p/H11005.42).
Meta-Analytic Structural Equation Model
Having demonstrated that SDT interventions are effective in
promoting health behavior change, we next tested whether thesechanges were mediated by autonomous motivation and perceivedcompetence. First, we meta-analyzed the impact of interventionson subsequent autonomous motivation and perceived competence.Second, we meta-analyzed the z-transformed correlations among
autonomous motivation, perceived competence, and health behav-iors reported in the primary studies. These correlations were thensubmitted to a meta-analytic structural equation model ( Jak, 2015 )
to assess whether autonomous motivation and perceived compe-tence mediated the effect of SDT interventions on health behav-iors.
The impact of SDT interventions on autonomous motivation
was tested in 45 trials; the sample-weighted average effect sizewas of small magnitude ( d
/H11001/H11005.23, 95% CI [.12, .34], Q/H11005204.65,
I2/H1100578.5%). The impact of SDT interventions on perceived
competence was assessed in 26 trials and generated a small aver-age effect size ( d
/H11001/H11005.21, 95% CI [.11, .30], Q/H1100561.45, I2/H11005
59.3%). We also tested whether SDT interventions influencedcontrolled motivation; however, the effect was negligible(d

65.3%). Because controlled motivation hardly qualifies as a me-diator of intervention effects, this variable is not considered fur-Table 1

Autonomous motivation had a medium-sized average correla-
tion with behavior ( r/H11001/H11005.27, 95% CI [.21, .32], k/H1100517). The
average correlation between perceived competence and behaviorwas also medium-sized ( r
/H11001/H11005.34, 95% CI [.24, .44], k/H1100512);
autonomous motivation and perceived competence were signifi-cantly associated ( r
/H11001/H11005.38, 95% CI [.26, .49], k/H110059). All three
average correlations were heterogenous ( Q/H1100555.16, 103.80, and
59.46, respectively, p/H11021.001) and heterogeneity was of substantial
magnitude ( I2/H1100571.0, 89.4, and 86.6, respectively).2
We undertook meta-analytic structural equation modeling of the
correlation matrices using the metaSEM package Version 1.2.3 in
R Version 3.6.1. Figure 3 presents the path model. The paths from
SDT intervention to autonomous motivation and perceived com-petence were both significant, and the paths from autonomousmotivation and perceived competence to health behaviors weresignificant. We tested the indirect paths from intervention to be-havior via autonomous motivation ( B/H11005.035, 95% CI [.006, .082])
and via perceived competence ( B/H11005.027, 95% CI [.011, .051]);
both indirect paths proved significant indicating that these con-structs mediated the SDT intervention effects on behavior. Thedirect path from SDT intervention to health behaviors becamenonsignificant (Estimate /H11005.046, 95% CI [ /H11002.008, .101]); 57.4% of
the total effect of SDT interventions on health behaviors waschanneled through the mediators.

to test moderation by sample, intervention, and methodologicalfeatures. Of the many moderators tested, only two factors pre-dicted effect sizes. Overweight samples ( B/H11005.508, SE/H11005.160, p/H11005
.002) and higher mean BMI of study participants ( B/H11005.053, SE/H11005
.017, p/H11005.010) were associated with larger effects. It is notable
that intervention setting, delivery, intensity, or source were notrelated to effectiveness, and interventions were effective irrespec-tive of the time interval between the end of the intervention andobtaining behavioral data, the use of active control conditions, andwhether the intervention targeted a single behavior or multiplebehaviors. We also assessed whether risk of bias predicted effectsizes; no significant associations were observed (see Table S6 in
the online supplemental materials).
Discussion
This is the first meta-analysis of the efficacy of SDT as a
conceptual framework for designing and delivering interventionsto promote health behavior change. Across 65 randomized tests,we found that the sample-weighted average effect size was d
/H11001/H11005
.23 (95% CI [.16, .29]). Interventions were similarly effective forphysical activity, dietary change, and smoking cessation. Despiteextensive efforts to include the gray literature, there was evidenceof publication bias and small sample bias. After correcting forpublication bias, the overall sample-weighted effect size reducedtod
/H11001/H11005.15 (95% CI [.08, .22]). The implication is that interven-
tions based on SDT lead to significant changes in health behaviorsbut the magnitude of behavioral change is small.

Mediation and moderation analyses were also undertaken. We
tested a process model of SDT intervention effects ( Williams et al.,2002 ,2006 ) using meta-analytic structural equation modeling.
Findings indicated that autonomous motivation and perceivedcompetence predicted health behavior, and these variables simul-taneously mediated of the effects of SDT interventions on healthbehaviors. We assessed more than 30 potential moderators of SDTintervention effects that pertained to features of the sample, inter-vention, and methodology. A single feature, the mean BMI of thesample, was associated with health behavior change, and thisfinding must be viewed in the context of the large number of testsof moderation.
Findings from the present meta-analysis support the efficacy of
SDT interventions in promoting health behavior change, but also
help to specify strengths and weaknesses of this approach. Keystrengths are that (a) SDT interventions engender significantchange in health behaviors, (b) the structure of the SDT findsempirical support in randomized tests; in particular, interventioneffects are mediated by the factors specified by the theory (auton-omous motivation and perceived competence), and (c) SDT inter-ventions are similarly effective irrespective of multiple features ofthe intervention (source, setting, mode of delivery, and intensity),sample, and methodology (e.g., use of active control conditions,long-term behavioral follow-ups, targeting multiple health behav-iors).
The key weakness identified by the present review is that SDT
interventions are not very powerful, especially given that theinterventions involved an average of 8.25 sessions and 9.52 hr ofcontact time. The experimental medicine approach ( Sheeran et al.,
2017 ) indicates that interventions’ power or behavioral impact
depends upon two component processes: Target engagement —the
extent to which the intervention engages relevant targets (here,autonomous motivation and perceived competence), and target
validity— the extent to which these targets determine behavior
change. We observed that the impact of interventions on autono-mous motivation and perceived competence was small and these
2We also tested whether the measurement of autonomous motivation
influenced effect sizes. Autonomous motivation can be measured in its ownright or relative to controlled motivation (i.e., absolute vs. relative auton-omy). Meta-regression analyses indicated that the use of absolute vs.relative measures did not influence either the magnitude of the impact ofinterventions on autonomous motivation ( B/H11005.07,SE/H11005.17,p/H11005.67) or
the strength of the association between autonomous motivation and healthbehavior ( B/H11005.05,SE/H11005.08,p/H11005.55).
3It seems reasonable to characterize the magnitude of the impact of SDT
interventions on health behavior change as small on several grounds. First,dvalues of .15 and .23 are conventionally considered small according to
Cohen’s (1992) characterization of effect sizes, and these values remain
small using Funder and Ozer’s (2019) recent and more lenient guidelines.
Second, the impact of SDT interventions observed here is approximatelyone-half ( d
/H11001/H11005.23) or one-third ( d/H11001/H11005.15) the median effect size, d/H11001/H11005
.44, observed in Lipsey and Wilson’s (1993) meta-analysis of the efficacy
of psychological, educational, and behavioral programs. Third, whenRosenthal and Rubin’s (1982) binomial effect size display (BESD) is
applied to d
/H11001/H11005.15, the rate of behavior change corresponds to an increase
from 46% in the control condition to only 54% in the treatment condition.Finally, because most interventions targeted physical activity, we con-verted effect sizes into a relevant metric—the number of additional stepsper day conferred by the intervention. For d
/H11001/H11005.15, number of additional
steps per day is only 814 ( Wright, Rhodes, Ruggerio, & Sheeran, 2020 ).
Thus, conventional characterizations of effect size, comparison with abenchmarking meta-analysis, and the use of the BESD and a meaningfulmetric of real-world impact each suggest that the interventions reviewedhere have a small effect on behavior.731 SELF-DETERMINATION THEORY INTERVENTIONStargets had small associations with behavior in the MASEM. That
is, effect sizes for target engagement and target validity both weresmall.
Why did SDT interventions not have a larger effect on the
specified targets? In the present review, the impact of SDT inter-ventions on autonomous motivation was smaller than that ob-served in Gillison et al.’s (2019) meta-analysis of the behavior
change techniques used in SDT interventions ( d
/H11001/H11005.23 vs. .41),
whereas the effect on perceived competence was similar to thatobserved in a meta-analysis of interventions to promote self-efficacy for physical activity ( d
/H11001/H11005.21 vs. .16; Ashford, Ed-
munds, & French, 2010 ). None of these reviews observed even
medium-sized effects ( d/H11001/H11005.50), however, which likely speaks to
the difficulty of changing autonomous motivation and perceivedcompetence for consequential health behaviors in field settings.
Two considerations may be important in this regard. First, it is
challenging to train people in positions of authority to adopt aneed-supportive communication style, based on SDT principles(Ntoumanis, Quested, Reeve, & Cheon, 2018 ). For instance, au-
thority figures may hold personality dispositions (e.g., dominanceorientation, authoritarianism), or beliefs about motivational stylethat do not align well with the principle of supporting others’ needsfor autonomy, competence, and relatedness. Need-supportive com-munication can be perceived as ineffective (“Sounds nice, but itwon’t work!”), idealistic, impractical, or too time consuming. Incontrast, people in authority may believe that a controlling com-munication is both effective and easy to apply, especially undertime pressure (e.g., when there are brief windows of opportunityfor one-to-one consultation). Furthermore, prevailing culturalnorms (within an organization or society at large) as to what theexpected and common (i.e., normative) approaches should be formotivating and communicating with others, can influence thedegree to which health care professionals, teachers, and othersadopt need-supportive communication. For these reasons, it maybe difficult to instantiate the need-supportive communicativestyles that could effectively promote autonomous motivation andperceived competence.
The second consideration is that there may be a tension between
public health goals and SDT’s conceptual goal of enabling indi-viduals to make authentic decisions about health behavior change
(i.e., make choices based on reasons that are fully endorsed by theself). According to Ryan and Deci (2017) , participants’ autonomy
should be considered an important outcome in its own right, andnot merely serve as a means for attaining specific behavioral goalssuch as tobacco cessation or increased physical activity. A reflec-tive and true choice could involve the decision notto engage in a
particular health behavior (e.g., not to participate in an exerciseprogram, or try to quit smoking or lose weight), and should,according to Ryan and Deci (2017) , be supported by health prac-
titioners. Although this stance is aligned with principles of modernbiomedical ethics (e.g., Beauchamp & Childress, 2001 ), there are
cultural, financial, and political constraints that must be navigatedby policymakers, practitioners, and researchers as they endeavor topromote health behavior changes that participants may not fullyendorse.
The effects of changing autonomous motivation and perceived
competence on health behavior change were modest in the presentreview, and of equivalent magnitude to the effect sizes observed inNg et al.’s (2012) meta-analysis of observational studies. How
might the SDT framework be extended so as to generate largerchanges in health behaviors? SDT focuses on individuals’ con-scious motivation, which suggests that developments might prof-itably address three issues. First, research on the intention-
behavior gap (review by Sheeran & Webb, 2016 ) indicates that
motivation often does not get translated into action, even whenparticipants have high perceived competence or self-efficacy(Sheeran, 2002 ). This is because motivation is only the starting
point for successful goal striving: People still have to manageself-regulatory problems such as forgetting to act, missing oppor-tunities, or getting derailed by temptations, distractions, or un-wanted internal states (e.g., mood, ego-depletion) to successfullyachieve their goals ( Gollwitzer & Sheeran, 2006 ). Koestner and
colleagues have shown that supplementing autonomous motivationand perceived competence with if–then plans or implementation
intentions (Gollwitzer, 1999 ) improves rates of behavioral perfor-
mance and goal attainment ( Koestner, Lekes, Powers, & Chicoine,
2002 ,2006 ,2008 ). Implementation intentions are plans that have
the structure: If [opportunity/obstacle] – then I will [response] .Figure 3. Meta-analytic structural equation model: Self-determination theory interventions promote health
behavior change via increased autonomous motivation and perceived competence. Solid lines indicate significantpaths; dashed line indicates nonsignificant path; curved line indicates that autonomous motivation and perceivedcompetence were allowed to covary ( r

particular times and places) or obstacles to goal attainment (e.g.,laziness, TV viewing habits), whereas the plans’ then part specifiesinstrumental responses to those cues (e.g., “I will go to the gym onMonday after work!”, “I will tell myself I’ll be full of energy aftergoing to the gym!”). M eta-analyses support the efficacy of
implementation intentions in promoting behavior change (e.g.,Adriaanse et al., 2011 ;Bélanger-Gravel, Godin, Bilodeau, &
Poirier, 2013 ;Gollwitzer & Sheeran, 2006 ).Koestner et al.
(2002 ,2006 ,2008 ) observed that autonomous motivation and
perceived competence have synergistic relations with if-thenplanning, which suggests that implementation intentions couldbe deployed to complement future SDT interventions on healthbehaviors.Second, SDT interventions do not explicitly target nonconscious
or automatic processes such as antagonistic habits (e.g., cue-drivensedentary behaviors) and implicit associations (approach/avoid-ance biases, automatic affect) that can militate against healthbehavior performance (e.g., Brand & Ekkekakis, 2018 ;Rhodes,
McEwan, & Rebar, 2019 ; reviews by Rothman et al., 2015 ;
Sheeran, Gollwitzer, & Bargh, 2013 ). It is also the case that health
behavior performance is not merely the product of individual-levelprocesses but is also a function of contextual affordances (Per-son/H11003Situation interactions). For example, changing physical
activity often requires interventions at multiple levels in additionto the individual level, such as modifying built environments,social environments, policies, and practices ( Sallis, 2018 ). Greater

would be valuable.
The validity of the present meta-analysis depends upon the
database upon which it rests. Despite extensive searches, includingthe gray literature, we could locate only 56 papers that yielded 65tests of SDT interventions. It appears that SDT, like other healthbehavior theories ( Sheeran et al., 2017 ), relies largely on observa-
tional evidence (e.g., Ng et al., 2012 ;Teixeira et al., 2012 ).
Additional intervention studies are clearly needed. Whereas phys-ical activity has been studied extensively, fewer RCTs targeted dietand smoking cessation, and there were very few tests of alcoholconsumption and adherence behaviors. Research is needed onthese understudied behaviors, and other consequential health ac-tions (e.g., vaccination, sleep hygiene) that have not yet beenaddressed by SDT. Studies of patient (e.g., CVD, cancer) andlow–socioeconomic status samples should be a priority. Longer-term follow-ups would also be desirable given that the meanfollow-up period was only 3 months in the present review.
Additional RCTs based on SDT will be of little value, however,
if findings are not published. The extent of publication bias wassubstantial in the present review, and though we attempted toadjust for bias via trim and fill analysis, behavior change byresearchers (e.g., trial registration) and reviewers (e.g., checkingRCT protocols) will be the best corrective. Primary studies werealso characterized by small sample bias. Future tests will need torecruit much larger samples than the mean number of participantsin the trials reviewed here ( N/H11005206) to achieve satisfactory power
(see Table S4 ). Finally, we could retrieve intervention effects on
autonomous motivation and perceived competence in only 45 and26 trials, respectively, and respective correlations with healthbehaviors were available for only 17 and 12 trials. Authors shouldroutinely report these data in future, and editors and reviewersshould request it.
The present review indicates opportunities for further concep-
tual and intervention development in SDT research. At the con-ceptual level, SDT theorists could begin to specify how structuralbarriers and antagonistic implicit processes may undermine self-determined performance of health behaviors, or how self-determination could overcome these influences. Additional tests ofthe efficacy of supplementing SDT interventions with implemen-tation intentions also are warranted. We observed that SDT inter-ventions had no significant effect on controlled motivation in thepresent review. Future studies might profitably test whether inter-ventions that simultaneously increase autonomous motivation andreduce controlled motivation have greater behavioral impact com-pared to changes in either type of motivation on its own. It isintriguing to note that the intensity of SDT interventions (contacttime, number of sessions, intervention duration) was not associatedwith effect sizes. This opens up the possibility that brief SDTinterventions could be effective and could serve to increase thescalability and reach of this approach. Finally, the funnel plots(Figures S3 andS5in the online supplemental materials) demon-
strated a good deal of variability in the impact of interventions onautonomous motivation and perceived competence. Further re-search geared at specifying the most effective change techniques inSDT interventions (e.g., Gillison et al., 2019 ;Teixeira et al., 2019 )
should serve to increase the impact of future SDT trials to promote
health behavior change.The present meta-analysis shows that SDT interventions have a
significant but small effect on health behaviors. The structure ofthe theory is supported by findings showing that autonomousmotivation and perceived competence mediate intervention effectson health behaviors, and that effectiveness of SDT interventionswas largely unaffected by features of the sample, intervention, andmethodology. Trials of SDT interventions to date are characterizedby publication bias and small sample bias, however, and more andbetter-powered RCTs are warranted to evaluate this framework.Our review offers several suggestions about how the effectivenessof future SDT interventions might be improved.
